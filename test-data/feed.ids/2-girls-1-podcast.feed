      <title>263 Millions of Fans Are Obsessed With "Sink Reviews"</title>
      <description>On a whim (and after a few drinks), Dean Peterson thought it would be funny to rate the bathroom sink of a local bar in NYC. His Instagram followers agreed, and "Sink Reviews" was born. When he began sharing them on TikTok, the party really got going.
Millions of views, followers, likes, and comments later, rabid fans of "SinkTok" came out of the woodwork, demanding more of this ridiculous content, especially as pandemic lockdowns showed no sign of letting up.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Dean about his viral fame, what makes a good and bad sink, social media burnout, how the Internet got weird again in 2020, and why his huge audience never turned into a full-time job.

      <title>Adult Breastfeeding Is About Way More Than Kink [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>We're off this week, but here's another classic 2G1P from the archives that blew our minds.
-- Original Show Notes From Jul 4, 2022 --
219 Adult Breastfeeding &amp; Nursing Relationships
You might assume that men drinking breastmilk is yet another kink — and it can be. But Mikalah says it's often a comfort and a lifestyle for many in the community. She would know, as she's a professional lactation consultant who also found a partner who breastfeeds from her regularly.
Alli and Lindsey speak with her about the extraordinary misconceptions about breastfeeding, how anyone at ANY age can induce breastmilk (including men!), the barriers to selling milk online, and the medical reasons why she found herself to be a leading voice in the ABF community.

      <title>262 We Got a Guided Tour of Second Life!</title>
      <description>Alli and Lindsey joined Second Life and got a grand tour of its public squares, roleplay venues, night clubs, a pony farm, and of course, the sex shops. New listener and longtime Second Life creator Sasy Scarborough guided them through the avatar creation process, and customizing clothes and body types.
They discuss why it was both fascinating, inspiring, and also hard to access without a tour guide, and why platforms with a certain technical "barrier to entry" are probably good for the Internet.
HUGE thanks to Sasy for making this episode possible!

      <title>261 The Families Suing Social Media Over the Teen Mental Health Crisis</title>
      <description>Alexis was a typical 11-year-old. She loved musical theater and Webkinz. But when she started using Instagram, her normal pre-teen curiosities triggered the social media app to flood her feed with content about anorexia and how to hide eating disorders from your parents. Over the next few years, Alexis' mental health deteriorated so much that she had to be hospitalized. Some families aren't so lucky.
Teen suicide rates have skyrocketed since 2007, and some research has begun to correlate that with the rise of algorithmic, for-profit social media. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become central to teenagers social lives, and it's probably not an accident.
Today, Alexis Spence has made a full recovery from her eating disorder, and with her mom Kathleen, has become an advocate for social media reform, especially through legal action. Alli and Lindsey talk with them, along with their lawyer, Matt Bergman, who co-founded the Social Media Victims Law Center. When suing Meta on behalf of families, his legal approach comes from product liability: If tech companies know their products are addictive and harmful to children and choose not to address that, they should be held accountable.

      <title>260 'Second Life' Turns 20, and It's Still the Metaverse We Always Dreamed Of</title>
      <description>In June 2003, a new community appeared on the Internet. It wasn't a Web forum or a hot new blog. It was a fully 3D virtual world where people could create an avatar, buy a house, wear fancy clothes, fall in love, and fly. For context, this is months before the world would ever hear the word "Myspace."
Twenty years later, Second Life remains one of the most vibrant online spaces ever created. While small compared to other social juggernauts, Second Life is home to thousands of fascinating subcultures and creators - many of whom make a fantastic IRL living from selling their art, clothes, and animations in-world. The financial symbiosis between the platform and the players who make everything on it remains unique to this day, even in a world of endless MMOs and live service video games.
Alli and Lindsey speak with author and journalist Wagner James Au, who has been covering Second Life and other virtual worlds since their inception. They're also joined by Sparkle Skye, a Second Life creator who quit her job in finance to make virtual wedding gowns full-time. They discuss the legacy of Second Life, its unique place on the Internet, and what's next for the platform in a sea of new "metaverses."

      <title>259 Lemmy: Self-Hosted, Decentralized Communities for Reddit Exiles</title>
      <description>In the wake of major API changes and the death of beloved 3rd party apps, scores of Reddit users have flocked to Lemmy, a similar online forum and news aggregating platform with one key difference: It's decentralized, and can never be owned by a single company or person. But this has nothing to do with blockchain or crypto.
Lemmy is part of the Fediverse, where self-hosted instances can interact with each other using common protocols. This is how other decentralized platforms like Mastodon work. Lemmy has been around since 2019, but as Reddit controversies continue, many instances of Lemmy have seen exponential growth in recent weeks.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Ruud Schilders, who hosts and operates what has become the largest Lemmy instance: lemmy.world. Ruud shares what makes federated social media so exciting, the challenges of content moderation, and the current blockers to mainstream adoption.

      <title>Who knew eating people could be so sexy? Inside the fascinating Vore fetish [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>This week we return to one of our most popular episodes: Vore! It also happens to be Jen's final episode. If you haven't heard this yet, you're in for a mind-expanding snack!
-- Original Show Notes | June 14, 2021 --
We often refer to attractive people as "snacks" and talk about "eating someone up." But vore enthusiasts take those feelings to the next level. The fetish is about consuming others, or being consumed, but it's completely fantastical of course -- no one is harmed in the making of vore content or roleplay.
This week, Alli and Jen talk with Carter, a moderator of the subreddit r/vore about the elaborate art created by the community, the discovery of his own feelings for the fetish, and why this kink is often misunderstood.

      <title>258 Replika: The Surprising Reasons People Get Romantic With AI Chatbots</title>
      <description>We hate to break this to you, but human relationships aren't perfect. People disagree, have conflicting values, and in the worst cases, become dishonest or abusive.
Instead, what if you could date the "perfect" person for you? A synthetic person that will never cheat or carry the emotional baggage that destroys relationships? That's the promise of Replika, a customizable AI companion with a large community of users, many of whom have developed romantic feelings for their bots.
If this sounds strange to you, you're not alone. Alli and Lindsey talk with Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz, senior writer at New York Magazine and The Cut, who has covered AI dating extensively. Her recent piece begs philosophical questions about the "purpose" of human relationships, whether it really matters if both parties are human, and what happens when we entrust these connections to for-profit tech companies.

      <title>257 We only worry about AI when it threatens OUR jobs</title>
      <description>We thought burger-flipping, truck driving robots would take the first jobs. Turns out, its artists, writers, and podcasters who should be the most worried, thanks to large language models like ChatGPT and media synthesis from Midjourney.
We get philosophical about what means to fall in love with a synthetic personality, and discuss the End Times that befell the East Coast last week. Thanks, Canada.

      <title>255 How 'Grand Theft Auto' Roleplaying Helped This Twitch Streamer Come Out</title>
      <description>Meet Jubby. He fell in love with Grand Theft Auto Online for way more than just "cops and robbers" shenanigans. There's a huge roleplay scene across countless private servers, some of which have become very inclusive LGBTQ+ communities. On "No Pixel" where Jubby spends most of his day playing and streaming, he took up the mantle of organizing in-world Gay Pride events, fashion shows, and music festivals. These days, he's a Twitch partner who credits these virtual communities with empowering him to come out of the closet IRL.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Jubby about virtual drag shows, the in-world and out-of-world resources required for these big events, and the future of the LGBTQ+ community inside massively popular video games like GTA.

        <![CDATA[<p>Meet Jubby. He fell in love with<em> Grand Theft Auto Online</em> for way more than just "cops and robbers" shenanigans. There's a huge roleplay scene across countless private servers, some of which have become very inclusive LGBTQ+ communities. On "No Pixel" where Jubby spends most of his day playing and streaming, he took up the mantle of organizing in-world Gay Pride events, fashion shows, and music festivals.

      <title>What Qualifies as "Free Speech" on the Internet? [Encore]</title>
      <description>Where in the world is Alli Goldberg? As she continues her adventures in Asia, we have another fan favorite encore episode for you!
-- Original Show Notes from July 11, 2022 --
The 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from abridging free speech and the press. And Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act prevents common carriers (like telephone companies) from being held liable for the speech of their users. But social media isn't quite either of those things, especially when a small handful of tech companies make huge profits by amplifying dangerous misinformation. So, what IS protected speech on the Internet, and what models of regulation are available to preserve open communication and a digital "public square," while curbing weaponized information?
Alli and Lindsey talk with Paul Singer, a partner at the law firm Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP and former Texas Associate Deputy Attorney General, who has been focused on consumer protection on the Internet since the days of MySpace. Paul explains why regulating online speech is incredibly complex, especially at the speed of tech. But he remains optimistic that the history of telecommunications — specifically radio — might guide us toward a legal balance.

      <title>253 Why Would Anyone In Their Right Mind Post on r/RoastMe?</title>
      <description>Hateful comments on the Internet are nothing new. But there's one special place where it's not only tolerated, but highly encouraged.
r/RoastMe is a 3 million-strong subreddit where people ask to be verbally obliterated by Internet strangers. Commenters can be as hateful, racist, and misogynistic as they please, as long as they follow the golden rule: It has to be funny. So who would open themselves up to something like this, and why?
Alli and Lindsey speak with Michael McElroy, arguably the most-roasted person in the subreddit's history, and Adyasha Mishra, a graduate student who is studying the social dynamics of this hilarious community.

      <title>252 Schools Are Suing Social Media Over Kids' Mental Health. Can They Win? (w/ Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN)</title>
      <description>Social media emerged as a way to democratize information and amplify marginalized voices. It empowered a new creative class, and fueled social justice movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. But as social apps are designed to squeeze profit from our attention, the dark side is now well studied. We've all felt the doom scroll addiction, anxiety, and depression that comes along with our constant need to see what others are doing — not to mention the privacy concerns. Now, consider the kids.
Citing massive spikes in teen suicides, bullying, and depression, some school districts are striking back at tech companies like Meta, Snap and TikTok for these abusive practices with class action lawsuits. So, do they have legs? And could any of these cases lead to stronger social media regulation?
CNN senior tech writer Samantha Murphy Kelly has been covering these lawsuits, and brings Alli and Lindsey up to speed on what they might mean for the future of how kids use the Internet.

      <title>Autcraft: The Minecraft Server for Kids With Autism [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>We've got two fresh interviews cooking for the weeks ahead, but for now, please enjoy this inspiring encore from about a year back!
-- Original Show Notes from May 16, 2022 --
Autistic children love Minecraft as much as anyone, but they're often bullied by other kids on multiplayer servers. When software developer and dad Stuart Duncan learned of this, he set out to create a private, safe Minecraft server exclusively for autistic kids and their families. The moment he shared it, he got 300 emails from parents who desperately wanted in,
Today, Autcraft has a community of 15,000 kids with autism and their parents, and Stuart quit his job to run the server fulltime and meet the needs of his players. He shares how the server changed the lives of kids and parents, Autcraft's accessibility features that Minecraft has implemented into its game for all players, and why social scientists study the server for autism research.

      <title>251 Her Epic Swag Collection Grows With Every Failed Tech Company (ft. Christina Warren)</title>
      <description>The Internet startup landscape is fraught with questionable business models, fickle users, and boatloads of misplaced venture capital. For every TikTok and Door Dash, there are thousands of spectacular failures. And most of them had the hubris to make (and sometimes sell) branded swag -- t-shirts, mugs, bags, and more.
That's where collector Christina Warren comes in. For years she's been hunting for authentic swag from tech and media companies that have gone bust: Quibbi, CNN+, Gowalla, Theranos, Enron and more.
Her collection has garnered international media attention and speaks to the hubris of companies who believe they're the next big thing ... until they're gone.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Christina about her days covering startups as a journalist, the extremely online landscape, the swag she's most proud of, and the "white whale" that continues to elude her collection.

      <itunes:summary>The Internet startup landscape is fraught with questionable business models, fickle users, and boatloads of misplaced venture capital. For every TikTok and Door Dash, there are thousands of spectacular failures. And most of them had the hubris to make (and sometimes sell) branded swag -- t-shirts, mugs, bags, and more.
That's where collector Christina Warren comes in. For years she's been hunting for authentic swag from tech and media companies that have gone bust: Quibbi, CNN+, Gowalla, Theranos, Enron and more.
Her collection has garnered international media attention and speaks to the hubris of companies who believe they're the next big thing ... until they're gone.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Christina about her days covering startups as a journalist, the extremely online landscape, the swag she's most proud of, and the "white whale" that continues to elude her collection.

      <title>250 Let's Go Inside a Catfishing Factory</title>
      <description>It's a tale as old as time: Boy meets girl, boy sends dick pic to girl, girl turns out to be a journalist writing a story about catfishing.
But these days, it's not just dating apps and Craigslist where lonely men are tricked online. A "Catfishing Industrial Complex" has emerged, with all the bells and whistle of modern customer service call centers, where multiple low-wage sex workers (of any gender) pretend to be attractive women sending intimate messages that men are eager to pay for.
Niamh McIntyre and Jasper Jackson went under cover at one of these operations to find out how they work and expose their abusive practices in a piece for The Bureau of Investigative Journalism entitled: "Please Acknowledge the Dick: Inside a Catfishing Factory." They chat with Alli and Lindsey about the horrors they discovered, and why this kind of sex work could be a positive force if it was more transparent and fair.

      <title>248 "Data Is Power" | Inside the Wild World of Excel Esports</title>
      <description>Many of us use Microsoft Excel to track expenses and run basic reports at work. But there are some who walk among us with super-human spreadsheet skills. The best of the best compete for cash prizes in Excel esports, an elite world that congregates online — and sometimes on ESPN.
Alli and Lindsey meet Oz du Soleil, a competitive Excel commentator, YouTube creator, and educator who specializes in "cleaning messed up data." He shares how he got into the wild world of Excel esports, how the community found each other online, and the fundamentalist factions at war in the Excel ecosystem.

      <title>247 Thousands of People Are Still Using (and Modifying) Their iPods</title>
      <description>Despite having all media at our fingertips, there are still thousands of people who prefer to put mp3 files on their Apple iPods when they listen on the go. In fact, there's a large online community of people who love the simplicity of the retro music player. For some it's pure nostalgia. For others, there's a deeper hobby.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Michi, a prominent modder in the iPod community, and Austin Lucas, the owner of Elite Obsolete Electronics, a shop that sells replacement parts and upgrades for these ancient devices. They discuss how people are resurrecting and Frankensteining their iPods, why the device has so much staying power 20+ years on, and the tale of one iPod that has traveled around the world.

      <title>246 Adult Fans of 'Bluey' (Don't Worry, It's Wholesome)</title>
      <description>The Australian children's cartoon "Bluey" has become a global phenomenon in recent years. But it's not just kids racking up all the views. Parents, non-parents, would-be parents, and all kinds of grown-ups are obsessed with this wholesome show about a family of dogs.
This week, Alli and Lindsey talk with Jeffery Dibble, the moderator of a Facebook group called "Adult Bluey Fans," which has ballooned from a humble 5,000 members to more than 230,000. There, they share Bluey memes, tattoos, fan art, wild (and conspiratorial) fan theories, and of course get into heaps of drama. Jeffrey, who is also a dad, shares why he and the community find this particular show (and its fandom) so special.

Parents, non-parents, would-be parents, and all kinds of grown-ups are obsessed with this wholesome show about a family of dogs.</p><p>This week, Alli and Lindsey talk with Jeffery Dibble, the moderator of a Facebook group called "Adult Bluey Fans," which has ballooned from a humble 5,000 members to more than 230,000. There, they share Bluey memes, tattoos, fan art, wild (and conspiratorial) fan theories, and of course get into heaps of drama. Jeffrey, who is also a dad, shares why he and the community find this particular show (and its fandom) so special.</p><p>Adult 'Bluey' Fans: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/3863578243733419/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/3863578243733419/</a></p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Discord community: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">http://discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>243 Emoji Are Deciding Court Cases but the Legal System Is Still ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</title>
      <description>Emoji have been popping up as pivotal evidence in legal proceedings ranging from real estate to drugs and sexual predation. The informal field of "emoji forensics" has lead to new caselaw about the meaning of some "non-textual" communication. But these waters are muddy due to legal interpretation, rapidly evolving Internet slang, and the many cultural meanings attributed to emoji symbols — not to mention that emoji may look completely different, depending on what software is displaying them, making it difficult to prove intent in court.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute, where he specializes in Internet law and intellectual property, especially as it relates to Silicon Valley. Eric has a special fascination with emoji, and shares the most popular symbols appearing in court, and how the law is adapting to disputes happening inside our text messages.

      <title>Tracing the Roots of Modern Web Culture Back to "Something Awful" [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>Take a trip down memory lane with this encore 2G1P episode, and we'll be back with you next week!
-- Original Show Notes From February 1, 2021 --
Since 1999, the website Something Awful has been an Internet culture tastemaker, and this closed community is still going strong two decades later — a rarity for online platforms. Many modern memes and web culture references have their roots on Something Awful's humor forums.
For a one time fee of $10, you get full access to the site's vibrant discussion and community. That nominal barrier-to-entry is the secret to keeping the discourse quality high and shitpost ratios low, according to the site's current owner, who goes by the pseudonym Jeffrey of Yospos.
Paying for high-quality content and meaningful online community has recently come back into fashion amid the chaos of free platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which make money at incredible scale by selling user data to advertisers. It begs the question: Did we build the Internet wrong?
Alli and Jen talk with Jeffrey about the early days of Something Awful, a place where you're "free to be an Internet weirdo." We also learn the origins of "Let's Play" video game culture, and ways the SA community fought hate speech long before most platforms took it seriously.

      <title>242 Could (Should?) an AI Lawyer Argue in the Supreme Court?</title>
      <description>If a robot can analyze mountains of caselaw in seconds, couldn't it also make the best legal arguments for a client? After all, AI already predicts markets, creates art, and writes music all the time. That's the premise put forth by the website DoNotPay, which typically uses its bots to fight traffic tickets and cancel unwanted subscriptions. But their latest marketing stunt is offering $1 million to anyone who would let their AI argue a case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.
To help us understand if that's even possible, Paul Singer returns to 2G1P to discuss the ethics of bringing an AI into a courtroom. He's a partner at the firm Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP and a former Texas deputy attorney general, and has spent much of his career focused on consumer protection with regard to emerging technologies. Paul, Alli and Lindsey discuss the philosophical implications of employing AI tools in the practice of law, and whether lawyers are at risk of losing work to bots in the foreseeable future.

      <title>Why Are So Many People Obsessed With This Supermarket Aisle? [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>We'll be back next week with some more weird Internet, but for now, enjoy this 2G1P Classic!
-- Original Show Notes // January 17, 2022 --
There's an aisle at your local ALDI supermarket that contains random stuff that rotates on a weekly basis, often without rhyme or reason. So naturally, there's a Facebook group with 1 million people who are obsessed with it.
This week, Alli and Lindsey talk with Stefanie Riley and Leigh Caldwell Dunning, friends who've worked in the blogging/journalism space for years until they discovered a shared love for Aldi's "Aisle of Shame." It prompted the blog and group of the same name, where they highlight and discuss the products (and people!) that pop up in the mysterious aisle, where you "go to the store for milk, and leave with a chainsaw." They share the secret bird call of fellow group members, the ALDI executives who lurk in their midst, and the surprising way this community has rallied to help members in need.

      <title>240 The Hilariously Weird Things Lurking in the "Depths of Wikipedia"</title>
      <description>Wikipedia is your one-stop shop for high level info on public figures, geography, and academic concepts. But the volunteer editors of the free and open digital reference also make copious entries about "low quality images of cats," "Blobjects," "National Moth Week," Osama bin Laden's porn stash, and that time the Dave Matthews Band tour bus dropped poop on people in Chicago.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Annie Rauwerda, a writer, longtime Wikipedia editor, and creator of "Depths of Wikipedia," which has more than 1.1 million followers on Instagram alone. Annie discusses how the culture of Wikipedia generates obtuse and often hilarious articles, concepts, and photos taken out of context. She shares the funniest things she's found on the site, and how a beef with a sketchy influencer propelled her to fame.

      <title>239 How to Get Underrepresented Scientists on Wikipedia</title>
      <description>Much like history books and media coverage, Wikipedia reflects the bias of our society. The difference is that anyone can edit Wikipedia to change that. By day, Jess Wade is a materials scientist at Imperial College in London. But in her spare time, she noticed that many extremely accomplished female scientists (and scientists of color) did not have Wikipedia articles devoted to them. Thus she began the rigorous work of proving their notability, even when traditional media coverage is lacking.
1,800 articles later, some of the scientists she's put in the spotlight have gone on to win prestigious awards and media attention. Alli and Lindsey talk with Jess about the community of Wikipedia editors who work tirelessly to keep the free online encyclopedia diverse when it comes to STEM.

      <title>This Subreddit Sends Holiday Gifts to Kids in Need [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>We're afk for the holidays this week, and re-sharing a very wholesome episode about Santa's Little Helpers from last year. Enjoy!
-- Original Show Notes from December 20, 2021 --
r/SantasLittleHelpers is the subreddit that fulfills the holiday wishes of kids in need. Alli and Lindsey talk with BackpackWayne, the creator/moderator of Santa's Little Helpers, which has been connecting generous redditors with families that have fallen on hard times for the last 10 years. Wayne recounts heartwarming stories of the kindness of Internet strangers, and shares how the charitable initiative — inspired by his mother — has turned into a yearly juggernaut of generosity.
Here's a sampling of the joy from last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFcpAHxDt8M

      <title>237 The Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and Discmaster (with Jason Scott)</title>
      <description>We often think of content uploaded to the Internet as "forever," but companies go out of business, media becomes obsolete, and servers are shut off. But for the first time in human history, we have the ability to preserve granular cultural memory. We just need the will to do it...and the server space.
That's why The Internet Archive (casually known as the "Wayback Machine") is saving 75 terabytes of information ... a day. This includes website images, tweets, podcasts, old timey radio broadcasts, phonebooks, VHS tapes, concert recordings, Twitch streams, software and much more. Most of this seems ephemeral, and a general waste of disk space. But the importance of a single tweet, video or long-forgotten blog post may not make itself known for years (or centuries?) to come.
This week, Alli and Lindsey speak with the free range archivist Jason Scott, who has become an ambassador for the Internet Archive. They discuss the importance of preserving memory, the Herculean task of categorizing it, ongoing efforts to improve archive diversity, the new software archive Discmaster, and the philosophical challenges of preservation when people disagree on what's important or historical.

      <title>236 What Is Mastodon, and Could It Replace Twitter?</title>
      <description>Twitter's recent chaos spiral, mass firings, and obliteration of safety standards under Elon Musk's new ownership has many extremely online people wondering if they should jump ship. But to where?
Mastodon is a non-profit, open source, decentralized social platform with Twitter-like follower structures, combined with Discord-like instances around shared interests, like "Infosec" and "Climate Justice." It was launched in 2016, but has surged in popularity in the wake of Twitter's uncertainty. But how does Mastodon actually work, and could it ever supplant Twitter as a viable network for public figures, journalists, and other online communities?
Alli and Lindsey speak with Amanda Silberling, senior culture writer at TechCrunch, who covers Mastodon culture and has written a beginner's guide to the platform. They discuss the pros and cons of the platform, its unique "instance" structure, its culture and politics, and whether or not Twitter even needs to be "replaced."

      <title>235 RIP Twitter, It Was a Good Run</title>
      <description>We hope your Turkey Day was delicious, for all those who celebrate. This week, Alli and Lindsey catch up on a variety of important topics, like: Are humans the tastiest meat? What are the things that bring us joy? Setting up a moon colony, and of course Twitter's rapid death spiral under the heel of its new Dark Lord. And how can we save the valuable subcultures that still thrive on the platform.

      <title>234 Deaditors: Updating Wikipedia, One Obituary at a Time</title>
      <description>When Queen Elizabeth II died in September, her Wikipedia page was updated before the BBC had even broadcast the news. That's because hundreds of volunteer editors had rushed in to make sure the page was updated and accurate the moment Buckingham Palace announced her passing.
But there is no single arbiter of what edits "stick" and what is updated or reverse by other editors. Yet somehow, Wikipedia remains mostly accurate and up to date when public figures die. To find out how this magic is possible on an Internet so filled with fake news and bias, Alli and Lindsey talk with Hay Kranen, a longtime Wikipedia editor and volunteer within the Wiki Media community, who coined the term "Deaditor," referring to editors who specialize in updating the pages of public figures who have passed on.

      <title>This Facebook Community Protects Food Delivery Workers [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>We have another encore episode that we're really proud of. We'll be back next with more Internet awesomeness.
-- Original Show Notes // October 11, 2021 --
If you live in a big city like New York, you know that delivery workers on bikes are vital for moving food and other resources from place to place, especially during the pandemic.
But workers using apps like Door Dash and Uber Eats often have little recourse when something goes wrong, like a stolen bike or worse, a traffic accident. They're not employed by the tech companies, nor the restaurants they serve. And they're not top of mind for police, especially when many workers are undocumented and hesitant to report issues.
That's where El Diario de los Deliveryboys En La Gran Manzana, a Facebook community for Spanish-speaking NYC delivery workers, comes in. That's where these daring cyclists trade tips and support one another when things go wrong.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Sergio, the creator of the group, which now has thousands of members. Special thanks to Santiago Gustin for translating our interview!

      <title>233 Gravestone Recipes Take TikTok By Storm</title>
      <description>Grandma's secret sugar cookie recipe has been passed down through the generations. In some rare cases, this sacred family tradition ends up on her gravestone — a final gift to the world, if you can find it.
One enterprising TikToker put her archival skills in motion when she began baking these gravestone recipes online — and went instantly viral. Thanks to the Internet, the secret cookies Grandma took to the grave can now be enjoyed by everyone.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Rosie Grant about how a school project in library science became an instant online community, where people around the world are locating gravestone recipes for Rosie to bring back to life.

      <title>232 How the VHS Kids Movie "Creating Rem Lezar" Found New Life Online</title>
      <description>In 1989, VHS home viewing was on the rise, and Blockbuster was dominating the movie rental business, with one caveat: They had yet to acquire many kids' movies.
At the same time, a 23-year-old film director set out to create a movie musical for kids about an imaginary friend who comes to life. For a brief period of time, the very low budget "Creating Rem Lezar," was one of the only kids movies on Blockbuster shelves across the U.S. When video stores started carrying Disney and the like, the blue-haired, tights-wearing hero was largely forgotten. Or was he?
The cultural memory of this strange musical B-movie persisted, with memes appearing on eBaum's World in the early 2000s, and was later covered by the Found Footage Festival, an online community that excavates VHS ephemera from the pop culture dustbin.
People around the world began to remember Rem Lezar, and popular Twitch streamers and YouTubers began referencing it in their videos. The direct-to-VHS kids musical had gained a second life (and cult following) on the modern Internet.
Alli and Lindsey speak with Joe Pickett, co-creator of the Found Footage Festival, Jack Mulcahy, the actor who played Rem Lezar, and Scott Zakarin, the film's writer/director, about this strange renaissance, and the future of the film.

      <title>Geocaching Is the Global Scavenger Hunt for Everyone [Encore]</title>
      <description>Some personal emergencies got in the way of this week's session, so we have a 2G1P classic for you about the worldwide scavenger hunt that is Geocaching!
-Original Show Notes from September 27, 2021-
There are little treasures hidden all over your neighborhood, and throughout the world. You just need a GPS app (and some sleuthing skills) to find them. That's the fun of geocaching, a global phenomenon where people hide containers (large and small) in public spaces and drop the coordinates on a map. Find one, and you might be the first to add your name to the log, get some free swag, or enjoy the experience of a lifetime.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Scott Berks, Chad Courtney, and Jessie Brown, the hosts of The Geocaching Podcast, the long-running show about this worldwide and ever-growing IRL scavenger hunt.

      <title>230 The Ethics of AI-Generated Art and Media Synthesis</title>
      <description>Midjourney, Dall-E, Google Deep Dream, and more technologies have rapidly emerged in recent years. What were once fringe novelties have become sophisticated networks capable of turning any phrase into museum-worthy art, in seconds. Large communities of curious creators are flocking to them, as the once-elusive power of drawing or painting can now be commanded from your computer keyboard.
But what does this mean for the future of art and artists? If AI can generate 1,000 iterations of your band's T-shirt or podcast logo, then our relationship to art itself is about to radically change.
Journalist and CEO of 330.ai Adam B. Levine returns to the show to explain how these technologies work, the communities forming around them, and what to expect in the near-future. We then speak with author and musician K Allado-McDowell, who established the Artists + Machine Intelligence program at Google AI to study the relationship between AI tools and the creators who use them.

      <title>229 Etsy Sellers Are On Strike</title>
      <description>Etsy — the online marketplace for bespoke, handmade goods — has a labor problem. Despite robust profits during the pandemic, the platform has made recent changes that are angering its seller community. Most complaints revolve around increased fees, forced advertising programs, middleware payment systems (with additional fees), and the algorithmic prioritization of cheap, mass-produced goods — arguably the antithesis of Etsy's "mom and pop" roots.
Kristi Cassidy, a longtime Etsy seller, voiced her concern on Reddit, and many agreed. Now, a variety of shops have gone on strike in an effort to raise awareness of the squeeze. This reignites the age-old Internet question of who has more power: The platforms that create the ecosystem, or the individuals who create all the stuff on the platform?
Alli and Lindsey talk with Kristi about this budding freelance labor movement, and its implications for other Internet gig workers.

      <title>Trolling Internet Commenters With Ken M [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>We have two amazing episodes coming up, but they're not ready yet! In the meantime, enjoy this encore episode with our favorite comments troll/Internet performance artist Ken M!
-Original Show Notes // April 26, 2021 -
Dumb comments at the bottom of news articles and Facebook posts are a dime a dozen. But for the last 10 years, Ken M has turned misinformed Internet commentary into a masterful comedic art. His brand of earnest, oblivious comment trolling (and the angry reactions of people who think it's real) earned him hundreds of thousands of fans, who screenshot his comment threads across the Web and laugh hysterically on Reddit and Tumblr.
While Ken M has become the stuff of Internet legend, the real man behind the troll accounts — Ken McCarthy — is a friendly guy whose day job is writing for Comedy Central. Alli and Jen chat with McCarthy about his creative process, why his brand of humor is still so relatable after a decade, Ken M imposters, and what happens when troll comments go too far.

      <title>228 The Museum of Other Realities</title>
      <description>Looking at a painting or sculpture on the Internet doesn't inspire the same awe as seeing the real thing in a museum. But standing INSIDE a painting in virtual reality is a mind-blowing experience you can enjoy from home, and socially with others online.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Robin Stethem, the founder and CEO of The Museum of Other Realities, a VR space that contains a rotating collection of exhibits from artists working in 3D virtual space. These range from sculptures you can shrink down and walk inside of, infinite paintings you can fly into, art that's activated by sound and body languages, and other experiences that are only possible with emerging tech.

      <title>Sign Language Is Rapidly Evolving in VR [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>In keeping with our recent coverage of VR communities, we're sharing this encore episode about deaf users of VRchat and the volunteer translators making a big impact in social VR. Enjoy!
-- Original Show Notes // February 3, 2020 --
Deaf users of immersive social platforms like VRchat can face a tough time communicating. Unlike other social media, VR spaces rely on verbal and physical communication rather than text. And sign language with current-gen VR controllers is limiting and clunky at best.
But groups of volunteer interpreters inside VR worlds are hard at work making sure these spaces are more welcoming and accessible for deaf users. The result is an empowering community of "Helping Hands."
This week, Alli and Jen speak with Quentin, a 19-year-old volunteer translator and VR enthusiast, who is bridging the communications gap between deaf and hearing people in VRchat. Quentin (a hearing person) shares how and why he learned American Sign Language, the tech limitations of signing in VR, and how sign language is evolving in VR to accommodate differences between headsets and motion tracking.
A transcript of this episode was provided by @Zazzy_chan! You can read it here: http://bit.ly/2UJ1Qcz

      <title>226 This VR Kmart Is Like Time Traveling to 1992</title>
      <description>VR is used to create immersive video games, fantastical social worlds, and surreal art. Or you can make a Kmart from 1992.
An enterprising community of VRChat players have built just that, and manage it every day, complete with employees, managers, cash registers, and products on the shelves, like Surge soda and Super Nintendo. It's one part role-play, one part time machine — a way to virtually visit what '90s American big box stores were like. And people from all over the virtual world are flocking to it.
Carbon Blossom, the communications manager for this virtual store, explains its origins, global appeal, and take Alli and Lindsey on a whirlwind tour through the history of retail.

      <title>225 World Vasectomy Day</title>
      <description>When filmmaker Jonathan Stack started to burn out on making documentaries about prisons and drug addiction, he decided to turn his attention toward building a positive movement. He noted that misconceptions about family planning are rampant, especially in developing countries and of course, on the Internet. So he co-founded World Vasectomy Day, a global movement for public health and destigmatizing family planning. And when he began interviewing men all over the world about why they had gotten their vasectomies, the overwhelming answer was: "Love."
Jonathan shares how the organization got started, and the online community of activists and doctors working to evolve the narrative around vasectomies.

      <title>224 No License for Disinformation</title>
      <description>Online grifters who peddle misinformation for influence and profit are a tale as old as the Web itself. But the more recent phenomenon of credentialed medical doctors decrying Covid a hoax and spreading anti-vax rhetoric has more serious ramifications. So who holds doctors (and other medical professionals) accountable when they spread misinformation online? The medical boards that license them should be investigating, but shocker: They're not.
That's where Dr. Nick Sawyer comes in. By day, he's an ER doctor, but in his limited spare time, he's the executive director of "No License for Disinformation," a non-profit coalition of doctors who created a way to report and de-license bad actors. Dr. Nick explains the difference between disinfo grift and the alarmingly coordinated political efforts to discredit science and damage public health. He also discusses the early momentum of this online medical community, and why it can be hard for them to organize (even on the Internet) amid backlash from corporate medical institutions.

      <title>223 ADHD Hobby Swap</title>
      <description>Ever buy breadmaking ingredients, crochet hooks, or a papier-mâché kit, only to spend a bunch of money and then get bored with your new hobby? You're not alone, especially during the pandemic. And those with neurodiversity, especially ADHD, can become hyper fixated on something, only to completely abandon it later.
The ADHD Hobby Swap Facebook group is a place where best intentions can be re-sold to like-minded hobbyists. It saves people money, reduces waste, and helps folks discover new projects they never dreamed of. Alli and Lindsey talk with the group's creator, Sarah Henley, about its explosion in popularity over the last few years.

      <title>222 The Electronic Frontier Foundation</title>
      <description>When the Web was created, it was open, inter-operable, and structured for everyone to participate. Today, most people consume online content through 5 mega-corps that make billions from our data and warp our social discourse. This has had profound effects on privacy and security. But how did we get here? And can we ever get back?
Alli and Lindsey talk with Cindy Cohn, the executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Since 1990, the non-profit EFF has been working to protect the civil liberties of Internet users. This ranges from government surveillance to corporate abuse of privacy. As a civil rights attorney, Cindy has fought and won numerous legal battles that protect online speech, privacy, and access.
She discusses the origins of the EFF, why law enforcement didn't understand the Internet at first, and the battles ahead regarding decentralization, tech anti-trust, and even abortion access.

      <title>The Space Cemetery in 'EVE Online' [Encore]</title>
      <description>We are afk this week, but re-sharing an amazing episode about the virtual cemetery in the space MMO EVE Online, which started as a memorial to dead characters and quickly became a shrine to IRL friends, family, pets, and lost loved ones who have died.
-- Original Show Notes, Episode 143 | August 17, 2020 --
Alli and Jen speak with Jason Marshall, a veteran player of the MMO 'EVE Online' about the game's 15-year-old player-run space graveyard.
The Molea cemetery has been operating since 2004, and not only contains the frozen corpses of killed space pilots, but graves that mark the deaths of lost loved ones in real life — friends, family members, pets, and other players.
In June of this year, the developers of 'EVE' formally recognized this player accomplishment by adding a massive, permanent memorial to the system. Marshall explains how the cemetery got started, why players care so much about transporting their clone corpses to virtual graves, how the team fended off attacks from the notorious Goonswarm Alliance, and the first time a player requested a grave for a real person.

      <description>Mushrooms, psychedelics, micro-dosing and more have recently come into fashion, but online communities and scientists have been studying their effects on mental health for decades. The social stigma on mind-altering substances still prevents many people from safely exploring them. That's where Plant Parenthood comes in. It's an online community that connects and educates parents on how psychedelics can reduce the stress of raising kids, and tap into the playful and creative mindsets that make families joyful.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Rebecca Kronman and Andrew Rose from Plant Parenthood, who explain the intersection of family and psychedelics, and how this community allows people to talk about things they can't address with IRL friends and family.

      <title>220 What Is and Is Not "Free Speech" on the Internet?</title>
      <description>The 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from abridging free speech and the press. And Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act prevents common carriers (like telephone companies) from being held liable for the speech of their users. But social media isn't quite either of those things, especially when a small handful of tech companies make huge profits by amplifying dangerous misinformation. So, what IS protected speech on the Internet, and what models of regulation are available to preserve open communication and a digital "public square," while curbing weaponized information?
Alli and Lindsey talk with Paul Singer, a partner at the law firm Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP and former Texas Associate Deputy Attorney General, who has been focused on consumer protection on the Internet since the days of MySpace. Paul explains why regulating online speech is incredibly complex, especially at the speed of tech. But he remains optimistic that the history of telecommunications — specifically radio — might guide us toward a legal balance.

      <title>219 Adult Breastfeeding &amp; Nursing Relationships</title>
      <description>You might assume that men drinking breastmilk is yet another kink — and it can be. But Mikalah says it's often a comfort and a lifestyle for many in the community. She would know, as she's a professional lactation consultant who also found a partner who breastfeeds from her regularly.
Alli and Lindsey speak with her about the extraordinary misconceptions about breastfeeding, how anyone at ANY age can induce breastmilk (including men!), the barriers to selling milk online, and the medical reasons why she found herself to be a leading voice in the ABF community.

      <title>Making Spreadsheets Fun With @BachelorData [ENCORE]</title>
      <description>We're off this week, but sharing another one of our favorite episodes about turning fandom into something amazing on the Internet.
-Original Show Notes // December 6, 2021 -
The only thing bigger than "Bachelor Nation" is "Bachelor Instagram." That's usually where the contestants, stars, villains, and conversations around the Bachelor and Bachelorette franchises go during each season. But educator Suzana Somers had a fresh idea. When she had to start learning Excel for her job, she got bored crunching pivot tables, so she inserted data from The Bachelor instead: How much screen time did each contestant get? Age ranges? Race and ethnic backgrounds? Roses awarded? Instagram followers? The results, which she visualized on Instagram, have been intriguing thousands of fans ever since. @BachelorData has become a big voice in the reality show conversation, and Suzana has turned it into an educational resource for those who want to improve their spreadsheets skills in a non-boring way.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Suzana about the origin of the account, the online Bachelor community, and the fascinating conclusions she's drawn from analyzing the franchise over many seasons.

      <title>218 How One Direction Fandom Shaped the Social Web</title>
      <description>Fandom is the essential glue that holds most online communities together. But Kaitlyn Tiffany says the One Direction fandom ⁠— particularly fangirls ⁠— have a lot to do with with how modern social media culture is structured today.
The author and journalist returns for her second appearance on 2G1P to discuss how the Internet fervor around 1D has influenced everything from commerce to politics to activism online. Her new book, "Everything I Need I Get from You: How Fangirls Created the Internet as We Know It," digs into the obsessive fan culture that could only be fully realized through the power of the Internet.

      <title>217 Doctors of TikTok Fighting Medical Disinformation</title>
      <description>TikTok might seem like a bastion of youth, fun dance moves, and fun challenges. But like most social media, it's rampant with misinformation and weaponized disinformation, especially about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, joined TikTok for the same reasons we all did: We were bored during the lockdowns. What she found on the platform was so horrifying, she had to step up and fight it.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Dr. Kat about her rise to social media fame as a newly minted science communicator. Her TikTok videos debunk persistent myths about the pandemic, explain how viruses and vaccines work, and call out other medical professionals who insist on spreading dangerous content. She maps why human bias, poor educational standards, and algorithms that only serve sensationalism created a perfect storm of misinformation on TikTok, and what scientists (and regular people) are doing to fight back.

        <![CDATA[<p>TikTok might seem like a bastion of youth, fun dance moves, and fun challenges. But like most social media, it's rampant with misinformation and weaponized disinformation, especially about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, joined TikTok for the same reasons we all did: We were bored during the lockdowns. What she found on the platform was so horrifying, she had to step up and fight it.</p><p>Alli and Lindsey talk with Dr. Kat about her rise to social media fame as a newly minted science communicator. Her TikTok videos debunk persistent myths about the pandemic, explain how viruses and vaccines work, and call out other medical professionals who insist on spreading dangerous content. She maps why human bias, poor educational standards, and algorithms that only serve sensationalism created a perfect storm of misinformation on TikTok, and what scientists (and regular people) are doing to fight back.</p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Discord community: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">http://discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>Unnecessary Inventions [Encore Episode 148] September 28, 2020</title>
      <description>We have another one of our favorite classic episodes for you this week, so kick back, relax, and enjoy this wholly unnecessary diversion.
--Original Show Notes: September 28, 2020--
Matty Benedetto is a product designer by training, but his sense of humor led him to a life of hilarious content creation instead. Benedetto builds Unnecessary Inventions, ingenious products that solve urgent problems you don’t actually have — like a drink holder for your shoe, or an alarm clock that snoozes itself so you won’t be bothered in the morning. His fake products (and their crisp photos and videos) are so popular that he’s garnered 4 million followers across social media, and a vast community of invention enthusiasts who either really want to buy these ridiculous items, or can’t stop suggesting bad inventions.
Alli and Jen talk to Benedetto about where his weekly inspiration comes from, why it’s so hard to think of a problem that doesn’t exist, and what happens when real brands get involved in the fake product business.

      <title>215 The Woke Bible: Messed-Up Bible Stories With a Modern Twist</title>
      <description>The Bible can be pretty dense and outdated by today's storytelling standards. But what if you could hear the story of Lot, or Judah, or Abraham, expertly recounted by a cool dude at the barstool next to you, with all the hot goss about incest, murder, and rape?
What started as award-winning Reddit comments on politics articles has morphed into The Woke Bible, an entire subreddit devoted to getting high and retelling Bible stories with modern vernacular, reality TV show references, and hip-hop lyrics.
Jason Washington grew up in a fundamentalist family with a strict religious education. But despite leaving the church later in life, he continues to find messed-up Bible stories fascinating ⁠— and so do tens of thousands of Redditors. Alli and Lindsey talk with Jason about his growing community, and how he's educating thousands about what the Bible really says.

      <title>214 Autcraft: The Minecraft Server for Kids With Autism</title>
      <description>Autistic children love Minecraft as much as anyone, but they're often bullied by other kids on multiplayer servers. When software developer and dad Stuart Duncan learned of this, he set out to create a private, safe Minecraft server exclusively for autistic kids and their families. The moment he shared it, he got 300 emails from parents who desperately wanted in,
Today, Autcraft has a community of 15,000 kids with autism and their parents, and Stuart quit his job to run the server fulltime and meet the needs of his players. He shares how the server changed the lives of kids and parents, Autcraft's accessibility features that Minecraft has implemented into its game for all players, and why social scientists study the server for autism research.

      <title>213 May the 9th Be With You</title>
      <description>Lindsey is on vacation this week, so Alli and Matt check the newspaper to see if there's anything going on in the good ol' USA this past week (Spoiler alert: There was!).
We also discuss the philosophical pros and cons of a more "decentralized" Web, and Alli pooped in a hole somewhere in Utah (good luck, Geocachers!).

      <title>212 r/Place and the Legacy of the "Million Dollar Homepage"</title>
      <description>r/Place is a blank canvas on Reddit. Every five minutes, you can add one pixel of any color. The result is thousands of Redditors working together (or against each other!) to carve out a visual space for their community, country, sports team, favorite video game, or a co-operative pixelated Mona Lisa.
This fascinating social experiment has been conducted twice on Reddit, but also has roots in a similar gambit from 2005 called "The Million Dollar Homepage," where pixels were sold to any person (or brand) with enough cash to make a statement on this early Web billboard.
Alli and Lindsey speak with Jay Hoffman, who documents this and many other Internet phenomena in his "History of the Web" newsletter. They discuss the extraordinary artwork created on this collaborative free-for-all, and why it never devolved into madness, thanks to a variety of self-policing communities.

      <title>210 How .GIFs Became the Lingua Franca of the Internet</title>
      <description>When Stephen Wilhite, the creator of the .GIF image, died last month at the age of 74, millions on the Internet shared their favorite (and earliest-known) looping animations in honor of the influential computer scientist. But how did this highly compressed CompuServe image format from 1987 become the ubiquitous communication method bursting from all of our smartphone keyboards?
Nearly all the coverage of Wilhite's death links back to one interview from 2012. Fernando Alfonso, III, a reporter at The Daily Dot (fine publisher of this very podcast!) tracked down the reclusive Wilhite to discuss the legacy of the .GIF, and why it became so pivotal in the maturation of the Web. Alfonso (now a supervising editor at NPR) explains why .GIFs were invented, why they blossomed with artists of the early Web, how hard it was to make them in the early aughts, and whether we should expect the .GIF to survive the next 10 years.

      <title>208 This radio transmission has broadcast secret Russian military codes non-stop since 1982</title>
      <description>Secret spy messages are "hiding" in the airwaves all around us. It may sound like another Internet conspiracy theory, but this one is the real deal. Shortwave radio transmissions are among the most reliable ways for military, government, and intelligence agencies to exchange information. And every day for the last 40 years, one shortwave radio station called UVB-76 has been broadcasting static, beeping patterns, and cryptic Russian messages to ... someone. The contents of the messages are unknown — they are re-encrypted regularly. Anyone can listen, but only the intended recipient(s) can decode them. But that doesn't stop a thriving community of online listeners who stream these stations for the entire Internet to hear, in the hopes of finding patterns or clues.
Alli and Lindsey speak with ZapdoZ, a YouTube streamer who also moderates a large Discord server devoted to cataloging the cryptic messages of this Russian military shortwave transmission. He explains the difference between Numbers Stations (for spies) and Military Stations (for armed forces), why streamers use spectral analysis to "look" at the sound, and how chatter on these stations may have hinted at the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

      <title>207 Tumblr Communities That Shaped the Modern Web</title>
      <description>Hey, remember Tumblr? It was the most popular blogging platform on the Internet...until it wasn't. But the communities that formed there have had a lasting impact on social media, notably the passionate fandoms that exploded in the mid-2010s
Alli and Lindsey speak with Elena Cavender, culture fellow at Mashable, who recently wrote the piece "Remembering Tumblr's strangest, most formative communities." It's a nostalgic look back at the single-serve "Fuckyeah" culture that celebrated everything from movie posters to history crushes, and everything in-between: Fanfiction, study communities, Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock, One Direction, serial killers, and even the legacy of destructive content like pro-anorexia blogs.
Elena walks us through the heyday of Tumblr (and its rapid demise), and how those communities inform today's Internet.

It's a nostalgic look back at the single-serve "Fuckyeah" culture that celebrated everything from movie posters to history crushes, and everything in-between: Fanfiction, study communities, <em>Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock, </em>One Direction, serial killers, and even the legacy of destructive content like pro-anorexia blogs.</p><p>Elena walks us through the heyday of Tumblr (and its rapid demise), and how those communities inform today's Internet.</p><p>Read her piece: https://mashable.com/article/tumblr-best-communities-nostalgia</p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Discord community: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">http://discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>[Encore] 167 Ships of the Northern Fleet (March 15, 2021)</title>
      <description>This is one of our favorite 2G1Ps of all time! We'll be back next week with some very cool new episodes.
--Original Show Notes: March 15, 2021--
The cult steampunk adventure book series "Ships of the Northern Fleet" has inspired a TV show, graphic novels, and even a breakfast cereal. But the influential show has fallen off the pop culture radar in recent years. That is until a TikToker named Mister Nickel brought a flood of nostalgia back to the Internet to reunite the rabid fan community.
Alli and Jen talk with Mister Nickel and the one and only Catie Osborn, the actor best known for playing Annie on "Ships" for multiple seasons (before the character's controversial death!). Nickel and Osborn share why "Ships" fandom is so special, and everything that's gone down since its viral resurgence on TikTok.

      <title>206 How AfterEllen.com Became a Safe Haven for the Early LGBTQ+ Online Community</title>
      <description>When Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet publicly on her hit TV show in 1997, it rocked the media. Her popular sitcom received parental warnings and ratings declined until it was cancelled the following year. Many wondered if Ellen, who was at the peak of her comedy game, would ever work again. We all know how that story played out. But for the LGBTQ+ community at the time, Ellen's "I'm gay" moment was monumental, and open the floodgates for representation in mainstream media. Meanwhile, as the World Wide Web was taking shape, many in the gay and lesbian community began to find each other online. AfterEllen.com became a hugely important Web forum and review site for people coming to terms with their sexuality in a media landscape that was still hostile to them.
Alli and Lindsey speak with Sarah Warn, the founder of After Ellen, about how the LGBTQ+ community found a voice online before the days of Google and modern social media.

      <title>204 How SuperBam Returned $10 Million to Internet Creators</title>
      <description>Making a living on the Internet is hard enough. But when you finally make something popular (a YouTube video, a TikTok) it's almost certain that someone will steal it and re-upload it somewhere else. It's not always malicious, but it can harm content creators' bottom line.
Some platforms have the tools to find pirated content automatically, but it can be difficult to reclaim lost revenue. That's where SuperBam comes in. It's a one-of-a-kind company that helps creators identify stolen or misused content and gain control of its monetization and other intellectual property rights, putting the tools once reserved for record labels and movie studios into the hands of online influencers.
Alli and Lindsey speak with Chris Landa, President and Co-Founder of SuperBam, about how the company got started, and how they've reclaimed $10 million in pirated revenue for creators.

      <title>202 The Open Insulin Project</title>
      <description>When life-saving medication costs more than rent, you know there's a problem with the system. The cost of insulin — the blood sugar regulator relied on by diabetic patients around the world — has skyrocketed in recent years. Pharmaceutical patents and the lack of competition are usually the culprit. But one group of volunteers from around the world has been working to reverse-engineer insulin and get the "recipe" into production in order to bring down the cost exponentially. Think of it as an "open source" biohacking project, the results of which can benefit everyone — not just Big Pharma.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Anthony Di Franco, the founder of the Open Insulin Foundation, about how this all works, how volunteers collaborate online, and the future of the diabetic community on the Web.

        <![CDATA[<p>When life-saving medication costs more than rent, you know there's a problem with the system. The cost of insulin — the blood sugar regulator relied on by diabetic patients around the world — has skyrocketed in recent years. Pharmaceutical patents and the lack of competition are usually the culprit. But one group of volunteers from around the world has been working to reverse-engineer insulin and get the "recipe" into production in order to bring down the cost exponentially. Think of it as an "open source" biohacking project, the results of which can benefit everyone — not just Big Pharma.</p><p>Alli and Lindsey talk with Anthony Di Franco, the founder of the Open Insulin Foundation, about how this all works, how volunteers collaborate online, and the future of the diabetic community on the Web.</p><p>Check out the Open Insulin Foundation: https://openinsulin.org/</p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Discord community: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">http://discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>201 Disney Bounders</title>
      <description>We already know that Disney theme parks aren't just for kids, and there are communities of grown-ups who take having fun a Disney Land very seriously! Disney Bounders are all about dressing up as their favorite characters without looking exactly like them, which would be a violation of park rules. To avoid confusing other guests (and getting kicked out of the park), Disney Bounders use regular clothes and household items to evoke the style of princesses, famous animals, and Marvel heroes without crossing that line. Think: Cosplay for the rest of us. And there's a huge community on social media swapping tips and sharing experiences.
Leslie Kay is the creator of Disney Bound, a Tumblr blog and social media presence that grew to define the "Disney Bounding" community. She shares the origins of the site, the extraordinary devotion of the fandom, and the remarkable creativity that goes into dressing for a day at the park. Also: Some amazing stories from Alli's time as a Disney World performer in Orlando.

      <title>200 Study Streamers</title>
      <description>Studying, writing, and remote work can be a lonely time. Add in a dose of global pandemic, and the endless isolation can be overwhelming. It's no surprise to see the growth of streaming communities focused on mundane things: Eating, writing, and today's topic: Studying.
Alli and Linsey talk with Giulia Mazza, a study streamer who spends hours a day studying for her Master's degree while hundreds of people watch on Twitch. Her audience is also studying and working, and as Giulia explains, the community has become a place for "positive peer pressure" and accountability in an age of endless distraction and isolation.

      <title>199 Aisle of Shame (ALDI Supermarket Fandom)</title>
      <description>There's an aisle at your local ALDI supermarket that contains random stuff that rotates on a weekly basis, often without rhyme or reason. So naturally, there's a Facebook group with 1 million people who are obsessed with it.
This week, Alli and Lindsey talk with Stefanie Riley and Leigh Caldwell Dunning, friends who've worked in the blogging/journalism space for years until they discovered a shared love for Aldi's "Aisle of Shame." It prompted the blog and group of the same name, where they highlight and discuss the products (and people!) that pop up in the mysterious aisle, where you "go to the store for milk, and leave with a chainsaw." They share the secret bird call of fellow group members, the ALDI executives who lurk in their midst, and the surprising way this community has rallied to help members in need.

      <title>198 Bricks in Motion: LEGO Animation Community</title>
      <description>It should come as no surprise that LEGO is big on the Internet, but one LEGO filmmaking community has been thriving online since 2000, long before YouTube was even a thing.
This week, Alli and Lindsey talk with Sean Willis and Chris Wynn, two admins from Bricks in Motion, a forum and Discord community that emerged from the ashes of Brickfilms, which was instrumental in bringing amateur stop-motion LEGO animation online for the world to share.
Willis and Wynn explain how link directories brought LEGO filmmakers together on the early Web, and how the official LEGO movies can trace their lineage back to this online creativity.

      <title>197 Douglas Rushkoff: How Should We Redesign the Internet?</title>
      <description>The Internet and the World Wide Web began as an open, inter-operable commons with limitless potential and creativity. So how did everything get so corporate? Author and media theorist Douglas Rushkoff believes the next chapter(s) of the Internet could take a cue from Wikipedia or the communal kibbutz, rather than a for-profit metaverse ... if we want it.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Rushkoff about the aspirational origins of the Web, what we can do to program a better future, and why millions of digital cottage industries are probably better than 5 insatiable tech conglomerates.
Rushkoff will be teaching a university course on this topic in New York: https://rushkoff.medium.com/re-designing-the-internet-2593fe7dae8d

      <title>[Encore] 93 Macrophilia (July 22, 2019)</title>
      <description>Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all who celebrate! We're taking some time off this week for travel and family fun, but looking forward to sharing new episodes soon. For now, a watershed moment for our community: The Macrophilia episode, #93 from July 22, 2019. Enjoy!
-Original Show Notes-
Macrophilia is a surprisingly popular fetish involving sexual fantasies about giants — specifically, giant women. Being at the mercy of giants, or being coddled or crushed by them are staples of the community, but size change motifs also are common. Stories and media about giants (like the 1958 horror B-movie Attack of the 50 Foot Woman) or size change (1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids) have become touch points for the macrophilia community, though many have also taken to making their own media and pornography using visual effects.
Alli and Jen talk with Pete, the webmaster of Giantess City, one of the largest online content and community hubs for macrophiles.

      <title>195 Why Internet Accessibility Is More Important Than Ever</title>
      <description>The Internet is a place for everyone to have a voice, but we often take the tools and apps we use to access it for granted. Software engineer Ather Sharif became acutely aware of this about 8 years ago when a car accident left him with a spinal cord injury. Even basic things like typing on a keyboard are now an enormous challenge for him and thousands of others with various disabilities.
Lindsey and Alli talk with Ather about how this changed the trajectory of his career. He is now an advocate for accessible and inclusive technologies and a PhD student at the University of Washington where he studies what we can all do to ensure the Internet is for everyone.

      <title>194 @BachelorData</title>
      <description>The only thing bigger than "Bachelor Nation" is "Bachelor Instagram." That's usually where the contestants, stars, villains, and conversations around the Bachelor and Bachelorette franchises go during each season. But educator Suzana Somers had a fresh idea. When she had to start learning Excel for her job, she got bored crunching pivot tables, so she inserted data from The Bachelor instead: How much screen time did each contestant get? Age ranges? Race and ethnic backgrounds? Roses awarded? Instagram followers? The results, which she visualized on Instagram, have been intriguing thousands of fans ever since. @BachelorData has become a big voice in the reality show conversation, and Suzana has turned it into an educational resource for those who want to improve their spreadsheets skills in a non-boring way.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Suzana about the origin of the account, the online Bachelor community, and the fascinating conclusions she's drawn from analyzing the franchise over many seasons.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 134 WeRateDogs (@dog_rates / Matt Nelson)</title>
      <description>We hope you're having a fantastic Thanksgiving! We are thankful for YOU, our listeners. Lots of great interviews to come, but for now, please enjoy this hilarious conversation with the genius creator of We Rate Dogs, from June 2020.
-Original Show Notes-
With more than 14 million followers across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, WeRateDogs is on a mission that everyone on planet Earth can get behind: Rating cute doggos from the internet on a (dubious!) 10-point scale.
This blend of adorable dog pics, comedic captions, and obsessive fan-submitted content has catapulted the novelty account (and its creator, Matt Nelson) into a massive online brand, which uses its influence to entertain millions, sell merch, and help dogs in need.
Alli and Jen talk with Nelson about the inspiration for the account, how its explosive popularity changed his life, the serious inflation problem in the Dog Rating Economy, that time J.K. Rowling and Lin-Manuel Miranda followed him, why everything's political on Twitter, and his perfect response when Arnold Schwarzenegger asked him to rate his donkeys.

      <title>191 Xtrades: Stock Trading Communities of Discord</title>
      <description>The finance world can seem buttoned-up, even intimidating. But journalist Omar Gallaga found an unlikely (but entirely logical) place for armchair stock market tycoons to share tips and make big plays: Discord.
But this community dispenses with the "finance bro" trappings of other day trading services. Xtrades is about learning, teaching, and dare we say it: having fun with the stock market. In the wake of Gamestop, crypto crashes, and the NFT boom, Xtrades is a chill place for legit financial exploration.
Omar wrote a compelling piece about his journey to becoming a compensated moderator of this paywalled community, and explains to Alli and Lindsey that while the learning curve is steep, it's entirely worth it.

      <title>190 Doximity: Why "LinkedIn for Doctors" Is Full of Medical Misinformation</title>
      <description>You'd think a social network only for professional doctors would be a bastion of reason and scientific discussion. Unfortunately as Dr. Paul Malarik points out, doctors are human, too: Full of bias, assumptions, and sometimes bad intent.
Dr. Malarik is a semi-retired psychiatrist who spends part of his time helping people get vaccinated against COVID-19, and the other part debunking vaccine misinformation on Doximity, a "LinkedIn" or "Facebook" only for doctors.
Alli and Lindsey speak with Dr. Malarik about why this professional community can't escape the social media creep of mis- and disinformation.

      <title>189 Occult and Witchcraft Communities</title>
      <description>Which witch should you follow on WitchTok?
Georgina Rose is a prolific creator of occult and witchcraft content, deeply informed by historical research. Despite how witches are depicted in popular culture, wicca (and other spiritual schools) are deeply naturalistic and tend to fill spiritual gaps where "traditional" religions fall short. Through her YouTube channel, Instagram, and podcast, Georgina explains the tenets of occult spirituality, while also drawing firm lines between science and spirituality: "Crystals won't cure cancer!" As with all online subcultures, thinking critically about where you get your information is key.
Alli and Lindsey have a fun and informative chat about the online world of the occult.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 96 Why Is There So Much Sonic the Hedgehog Porn? (August 12, 2019)</title>
      <description>We've got the week off, but wanted to re-share one of our favorite episodes from back in the day. Enjoy, and we'll see you next week!
-Original Show Notes from August 12, 2019-
There's plenty of sexy fan art for any movie, show, or game imaginable, thanks to Rule 34. But there's something about Sonic the Hedgehog that lends the character to very specific and often extreme fetish art, in limitless quantities. Why Sonic? Writer and weird Internet excavator  K. Thor Jensen walks Alli and Jen through the invention of the Internet's favorite blue speed demon, and the unique way he was positioned by his creators that set him up as a conduit for porn of all stripes.

      <title>188 Delivery Workers of Facebook</title>
      <description>If you live in a big city like New York, you know that delivery workers on bikes are vital for moving food and other resources from place to place, especially during the pandemic.
But workers using apps like Door Dash and Uber Eats often have little recourse when something goes wrong, like a stolen bike or worse, a traffic accident. They're not employed by the tech companies, nor the restaurants they serve. And they're not top of mind for police, especially when many workers are undocumented and hesitant to report issues.
That's where El Diario de los Deliveryboys En La Gran Manzana, a Facebook community for Spanish-speaking NYC delivery workers, comes in. That's where these daring cyclists trade tips and support one another when things go wrong.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Sergio, the creator of the group, which now has thousands of members. Special thanks to Santiago Gustin for translating our interview!

That's where El Diario de los Deliveryboys En La Gran Manzana, a Facebook community for Spanish-speaking NYC delivery workers, comes in. That's where these daring cyclists trade tips and support one another when things go wrong.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Sergio, the creator of the group, which now has thousands of members. Special thanks to Santiago Gustin for translating our interview!

      <title>187 Online Farmers Markets</title>
      <description>Most things in the online world are meant to scale big, and reach as many people as possible all over the world. But for locally-grown food, not so much. So when the pandemic accelerated the need for local farms to get online, companies like Fresh Harvest stepped up.
This week, Alli and Lindsey talk with Zac Harrison, the founder of Fresh Harvest, and Nicholas and Jeni of Crystal Organic Farm, a local farm in Georgia that distributes through the site. They discuss the importance of locally-grown food, and how the Internet can get it to people more effectively.

      <title>186 Geocachers</title>
      <description>There are little treasures hidden all over your neighborhood, and throughout the world. You just need a GPS app (and some sleuthing skills) to find them. That's the fun of geocaching, a global phenomenon where people hide containers (large and small) in public spaces and drop the coordinates on a map. Find one, and you might be the first to add your name to the log, get some free swag, or enjoy the experience of a lifetime.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Scott Berks, Chad Courtney, and Jessie Brown, the hosts of The Geocaching Podcast, the long-running show about this worldwide and ever-growing IRL scavenger hunt.

      <title>185 Dead Internet Theory: What If Everything Online Is Fake? </title>
      <description>After noting cyclical patterns in the news and online discourse, combined with the rise of bots and overwhelming presence of advertising, some skeptical thinkers have proposed the "Dead Internet Theory," an idea that most (if not all?) online content is created by highly sophisticated bots. Where this interesting conspiracy goes awry is that — you guessed it — it's all a government coverup designed to keep us (the remaining human sheeple) in line.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Kaitlyn Tiffany, a writer at The Atlantic who reports on Internet culture, about how this compelling thought experiment quickly went off the rails into absurd existential solipsism.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 137 Second Life Sex Workers (June 22, 2020)</title>
      <description>Here's a look back at one of our favorite episodes about sex work inside the still-thriving virtual world of Second Life. We hope you enjoy this one as much as we did, and we'll talk with you next week!
-- Original Show Notes | June 22, 2020 --
Cybersex is as old as the Internet itself. But as virtual spaces become more sophisticated, so too has sex work. Second Life is more of a "technology playground" than a video game -- a place where your digital skills can be traded for real money. Many players make a healthy living by providing custom goods or services, including sex work.
This week, Alli and Jen speak with Meela Vanderbuilt, the creator and owner of The Mondarchy, the most expensive brothel in Second Life. She's also joined by Reyna, the club's general staff manager. Together, they explain the culture of Second Life (which began way back in 2003), why Meela's brown-skinned avatar was rejected by other clubs. the inspiration for starting her own, and how sex work...works in a virtual world.
Special thanks to Quintin Smith for help with this episode. His outstanding video about The Monarchy and Meela's story can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR94zlsHFdc

      <title>184 Cereal (with Dan Goubert of The Empty Bowl)</title>
      <description>We shouldn't be surprised to find huge, passionate online communities about something as mundane as breakfast cereal. Dan Goubert has been sharing his love of cereal and tapping into the fandom for years with his blog Cerealously.net. There, he muses about cereal culture, delicious (and horrifying!) new products, posts meticulous reviews, and occasionally breaks breakfast news. The blog became so popular it caught the attention of podcast maven and cereal eater Justin McElroy. The two teamed up to create the soothing, meditative podcast The Empty Bowl.
Alli and Lindsey chat with Goubert about why cereal has such a rich mythos in American culture, what decades-old collectable cereal tastes like, Lin-Manuel Miranda's cereal preferences, and why his podcast is a great sleep aid.

The two teamed up to create the soothing, meditative podcast <em>The Empty Bowl.</em></p><p>Alli and Lindsey chat with Goubert about why cereal has such a rich mythos in American culture, what decades-old collectable cereal tastes like, Lin-Manuel Miranda's cereal preferences, and why his podcast is a great sleep aid.</p><p>Shout out to StreetlampKid in our Discord community for suggesting this topic!</p><p>Check out http://www.cerealously.net/</p><p>The Empty Blow: https://www.themcelroy.family/emptybowl</p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Discord community: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">http://discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>182 Welcome to The Omegaverse</title>
      <description>We've all read sexy fanfiction from time to time, but a huge community of collaborative writers (and TikTokers) have taken it to a new level over the last decade. Enter: The Omegaverse, a complex, hierarchical world of sexual politics and impregnation, based on the mating habits of pack animals. And despite its fantastical nature, it's now striving to address real-world issues as well.
Alli and Lindsey speak with Morgan Sung, Internet culture reporter at Mashable, about her quest to unravel the complex social fabric of fanfiction built on other fanfiction. Morgan explains how Alphas, Betas, and Omegas interact when it comes to sex in the Omegaverse, why the strict hierarchical rules are made to be broken, the looming lawsuit that could change fanfic ownership forever, and why memes about breeding are blowing up on TikTok,

      <title>[Encore Episode] 160 How the Internet Is Changing Language (w/ Gretchen McCulloch) - Originally Published January 18, 2021</title>
      <description>We're working out some scheduling snafus this week, but we'll be back again with fresh tales from the depths of the Internet. For now, we have an encore episode about a really fascinating topic we covered back in January. We hope you enjoy, and we'll see you again next week!
Original notes:
If you're concerned that LOLspeak and text messages are ruining language, fear not, grammar nerds! This week, Alli and Jen speak with linguist, author, and fellow podcaster Gretchen McCulloch, who says we are living in a special time for informal written language.
McCulloch explains why the Internet is changing language and culture in unprecedented ways, how regular people solved the 500-year-long quest for written sarcasm, and why post cards from George Harrison look like your dad's text messages.

      <title>180 Sneakerheads</title>
      <description>Everyone loves a good pair of sneakers. But some people *REALLY* love a good pair of sneakers. And when they meet online, a lot can pop off.
This week, Lindsey and Alli talk with Josh Luber, the co-founder of StockX, the largest marketplace for collectibles like sneakers, streetwear and trading cards. Luber discusses the explosion of the online sneaker community, and which pair in your closet might fetch the highest price.

      <title>179 The Psychology of Online Sex Work</title>
      <description>The Internet has removed gatekeepers for most forms of media, porn certainly among them. The rise of Only Fans and direct-to-consumer sex work has empowered millions of adult creators (mostly women) to take back control of their NSFW products. But as we've seen across influencer culture, the psychological tradeoffs can be high.
Alli and Lindsey talk with Dr. Rebecca Sullivan, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at the University of Calgary, who has researched (and written books) about pornography and sex work for many years. Dr. Sullivan explores the double-edged sword when it comes to online sex work, and why our culture of objectification still poses serious threats to women, even when they're in control.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 170 #FreeBritney (April 12, 2021)</title>
      <description>We are recording some excellent episodes this week and figuring out summer schedules.. In the meantime, we thought it would be useful to revisit the #FreeBritney movement and community, as Britney Spears' conservatorship trial has ramped up in the news recently. If you're not exactly sure what's at stake, this episode is an excellent rundown of the history.
- Original Show Notes: April 12, 2021) -
In 2007, Britney Spears was placed under a conservatorship, relinquishing control of her finances to her father. This legal arrangement is typically constructed for elderly people with significant assets and declining faculties. In Spears' case, the pop star continues to perform and generate income regularly, yet cannot prove to the probate court that she has overcome whatever mental health challenges might have lead to the conservatorship in the first place.
The result has been increased public scrutiny and a large online community of activists, crystalized in the recent New York Times / Hulu documentary "Framing Britney Spears." The #FreeBritney movement, once dismissed as a vocal pocket of obsessive fandom, is now fighting to reform the abusive laws that bound Britney, and likely thousands more.
Alli and Jen speak with Leanne Simmons and Kevin Wu, two activists who moderate the @FreeBritneyLA communities, and were featured in the New York Times documentary.

      <title>178 Otherkin</title>
      <description>Science and society have established that gender and sexuality are fluid. And fetishes can certainly cross into some furry territory. But what about species?
A large community of people identify not as human, but as other animals: foxes, wolves, etc. And in some cases, even as humanoid races from folklore, like elves and fairies.
So where does biological humanness end and spiritual identity begin? This week, Alli and Lindsey explore the fascinating communities of Otherkin. They speak with identities journalist Ana Valens, who covers Otherkin extensively for The Daily Dot.
Then they speak with Kasi Frost, a member of the Otherkin community, who explains their journey of self-discovery and online engagement.

      <title>175 Vore</title>
      <description>We often refer to attractive people as "snacks" and talk about "eating someone up." But vore enthusiasts take those feelings to the next level. The fetish is about consuming others, or being consumed, but it's completely fantastical of course -- no one is harmed in the making of vore content or roleplay.
This week, Alli and Jen talk with Carter, a moderator of the subreddit r/vore about the elaborate art created by the community, the discovery of his own feelings for the fetish, and why this kink is often misunderstood.

      <title>174 LARPing</title>
      <description>People have been role-playing on the Internet since...the very birth of the Internet itself. And out of the tabletop and digital versions sprang LARP: Live Action Role-Playing. Social media like Facebook and Discord have given rise to thriving and diverse groups of in-person adventurers who dress up and meet up for sprawling campaigns, intrigue, battles, romances, and mugs of imaginary(?) ale.
This week, Alli and Jen chat with Rachael Cofield, the director at Garden of Destinies LARP, who also works with the organization LARPing In Color, which strives for more inclusion and diversity in the role-playing community. Cofield discusses their passion for role-playing, the community effort that goes into non-profit LARP, why some prefer "big box" LARP, how LARP survived the pandemic, and ways the community is reckoning with this historically male-dominated hobby.

      <itunes:subtitle>A tale of two LARPs.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>People have been role-playing on the Internet since...the very birth of the Internet itself. And out of the tabletop and digital versions sprang LARP: Live Action Role-Playing. Social media like Facebook and Discord have given rise to thriving and diverse groups of in-person adventurers who dress up and meet up for sprawling campaigns, intrigue, battles, romances, and mugs of imaginary(?) ale.
This week, Alli and Jen chat with Rachael Cofield, the director at Garden of Destinies LARP, who also works with the organization LARPing In Color, which strives for more inclusion and diversity in the role-playing community. Cofield discusses their passion for role-playing, the community effort that goes into non-profit LARP, why some prefer "big box" LARP, how LARP survived the pandemic, and ways the community is reckoning with this historically male-dominated hobby.

      <title>173 The Satanic Temple (with co-founder Lucien Greaves)</title>
      <description>Any mention of "Satan" is sure to elicit pearl-clutching from the religious right. But The Satanic Temple, a purely secular and non-theistic organization has been using the dogmatic baggage of that word to its advantage since 2012. This week, Alli and Jen talk with the Temple's co-founder Lucien Greaves about the origins of The Satanic Temple as a way to protest the evangelical agenda, its journey to becoming an officially recognized religion, and the secular people who find community among its ranks, both online and IRL.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 121 Gone Wild Audio (February 24, 2020)</title>
      <description>Due to scheduling conflicts, we've got an encore for you this week, and it's one of our most popular episodes of all time! Enjoy, or re-enjoy!
Original Notes
Nearly 400,000 listeners subscribe to r/GoneWildAudio, a community for high quality, audio-only erotic vignettes. Creators there use high-end microphones to create specific, explicit, and often elaborate fantasies for listeners. The visuals are left entirely to the imagination, and the intimacy level is off the charts.
This week, Alli and Jen speak with Belle_in_the_woods, one of the most popular and prolific erotic audio creators on the subreddit. She explains how she comes up with her sexy scenarios, how creators and listeners collaborate, what a "ramblefap" is, and how she's turned her talents into a thriving side hustle of both erotic, and SFW audio production.

      <title>172 Video Game Speedrunners (with world-record holder Niftski)</title>
      <description>For years, 4 minutes and 55 seconds was the fastest a human being could beat "Super Mario Bros." for the NES. After every technique, glitch, and warp had been analyzed for decades, the "55 barrier" was long thought to be unbreakable. That is, until early April, when speedrunner and Twitch streamer Niftski incorporated a specific flagpole glitch into his technique. The results were historic: 4:54:948, the fastest SMB run ever, making him a new world record holder.
This week, Alli and Jen talk with Niftski about his extraordinary accomplishment and the community of speedrunners who have worked together for years in search of :54. Niftski explains how runners exploit glitches, subpixels, wrong wraps, and other techniques to shave milliseconds and frames off extraordinarily precise runs. He also discusses the friendly competition among top runners that keeps them motivated.

      <title>171 Ken M</title>
      <description>Dumb comments at the bottom of news articles and Facebook posts are a dime a dozen. But for the last 10 years, Ken M has turned misinformed Internet commentary into a masterful comedic art. His brand of earnest, oblivious comment trolling (and the angry reactions of people who think it's real) earned him hundreds of thousands of fans, who screenshot his comment threads across the Web and laugh hysterically on Reddit and Tumblr.
While Ken M has become the stuff of Internet legend, the real man behind the troll accounts — Ken McCarthy — is a friendly guy whose day job is writing for Comedy Central. Alli and Jen chat with McCarthy about his creative process, why his brand of humor is still so relatable after a decade, Ken M imposters, and what happens when troll comments go too far.

      <title>170 #FreeBritney</title>
      <description>In 2007, Britney Spears was placed under a conservatorship, relinquishing control of her finances to her father. This legal arrangement is typically constructed for elderly people with significant assets and declining faculties. In Spears' case, the pop star continues to perform and generate income regularly, yet cannot prove to the probate court that she has overcome whatever mental health challenges might have lead to the conservatorship in the first place.
The result has been increased public scrutiny and a large online community of activists, crystalized in the recent New York Times / Hulu documentary "Framing Britney Spears." The #FreeBritney movement, once dismissed as a vocal pocket of obsessive fandom, is now fighting to reform the abusive laws that bound Britney, and likely thousands more.

      <itunes:summary>In 2007, Britney Spears was placed under a conservatorship, relinquishing control of her finances to her father. This legal arrangement is typically constructed for elderly people with significant assets and declining faculties. In Spears' case, the pop star continues to perform and generate income regularly, yet cannot prove to the probate court that she has overcome whatever mental health challenges might have lead to the conservatorship in the first place.
The result has been increased public scrutiny and a large online community of activists, crystalized in the recent New York Times / Hulu documentary "Framing Britney Spears." The #FreeBritney movement, once dismissed as a vocal pocket of obsessive fandom, is now fighting to reform the abusive laws that bound Britney, and likely thousands more.

      <title>169 Why the Creator of Nyan Cat Could Have Made Millions, But Didn't</title>
      <description>In 2011, Chris Torres drew a pixelated cat with a Pop Tart body and a rainbow shooting out of its butt. It raised $100 for a charity in Texas.
10 years later, it's not only one of the Internet's most iconic images (representing the silliness of the social media age), but has sold at auction as a non-fungible token (NFT) for 300 Ether -- currently, the equivalent of $590,000.
So how can you own an Internet meme, which is by definition a digital file that has been shared and remixed millions of times across the Web?
Alli and Jen talk with Torres about the cultural impact of Nyan Cat, his strange online journey over the last 10 years, how he could have made millions from licensing deals and toys (but didn't), and the pros and cons of NFTs and blockchain art.

      <title>168 Dogecoin and the Decentralized Dance Party</title>
      <description>Since 2013, The Doge meme has made us laugh, cry, and stare longingly into the beautiful eyes of a Shiba Inu. Like most memes, it’s an image put into new contexts again and again.
And in late 2013, it was turned into a cryptocurrency. Dogecoin began as a joke — a way to poke fun at the rise of blockchain and crypto trends. But today, it's incredibly popular as a commodity and digital currency, with an estimated market cap of $5 billion (as of this writing).
Gary Lachance, an open source and decentralization advocate, has embraced The Way of the Doge. He explains that if a philosophy of fun and openness underpinned our monetary system, perhaps the world would be a better place. And Lachance feels we're at the start of a global transformation, if we use the internet right.
This week, Alli and Jen speak with Lachance about his creation of Decentralized Dance Parties which unify thousands across the internet through music. Lachance also takes us into the Dogecoin community, and illustrates how the internet can be used as a weapon of peace, rather than control.

      <title>167 Ships of the Northern Fleet</title>
      <description>The cult steampunk adventure book series "Ships of the Northern Fleet" has inspired a TV show, graphic novels, and even a breakfast cereal. But the influential show has fallen off the pop culture radar in recent years. That is until a TikToker named Mister Nickel brought a flood of nostalgia back to the Internet to reunite the rabid fan community.
Alli and Jen talk with Mister Nickel and the one and only Catie Osborn, the actor best known for playing Annie on "Ships" for multiple seasons (before the character's controversial death!). Nickel and Osborn share why "Ships" fandom is so special, and everything that's gone down since its viral resurgence on TikTok.

      <title>166 How 'Blaseball' Fans Help Create the Game They Love</title>
      <description>Bored during the pandemic? Maybe you should try betting fake money on a league of simulated baseball teams where imaginary players like Jessica Telephone and Jaylen Hotdogfingers are regularly incinerated, undergo life-altering surgeries, and become ... encased in giant peanut shells?
Welcome to "Blaseball," the absurdist browser-based game that has captured thousands of imaginations and spawned an obsessive fandom that creates art, backstories, podcasts, multi-verse wikis, and even music about the events that transpire on the simulated field — which is then incorporated into the game itself.
Alli and Jen talk with Felix Kramer, a member of the "Blaseball" development team, as well as Elliot Trinidad and Bria Davis, two volunteer "groundskeepers" who manage the game's rocketing community. They discuss what makes "Blaseball" so special, why the fandom is radically different than those around scripted entertainment, and their plans for the new season in 2021.

      <title>165 Consensus-Based Reality: How Blockchain Communities Could Change the World</title>
      <description>When people talk about Bitcoin and blockchain tech, the conversation typically moves to the price of commodities and the hype around trading them. But the actual blockchain movement is about so much more.
Alli and Jen talk with Adam B. Levine, the podcast editor at CoinDesk, who breaks down how our trust in banks, governments, and monetary policy has failed us in the 20th century, and why cryptocurrencies re-assign that trust to math and a "consensus-based reality" — that is, a majority of people agreeing what is true, and making better policy decisions based on accountability. Levine also discusses why some cryptocurrencies are poised to radically change the world, while others are just about the memes...until they're not.

      <title>164 Why Disinformation Spreads So Quickly in Online Communities</title>
      <description>While we love Internet communities, it's clear that some can seed and spread weaponized information at breakneck speeds. Platforms facilitate this, but social dynamics are also at work here. And if there's any hope of squashing disinformation, it's time to take a hard look at the communities that are incentivized to manufacture it.
Alli and Jen talk with Bridget Todd, an activist and host of the podcast "There Are No Girls on the Internet," whose recent series "Disinformed" is about making sense of how dangerous online information culminated in an insurrection at the Capitol. Bridget explains why social media algorithms are biased toward disinformation, what you can do to stop the spread (even if you're not an "influencer"), why "Pinterest Moms" aren't helping, and why you don't need to have a take on EVERYTHING that happens in the news.

      <title>163 The_Donald</title>
      <description>Here on 2 GIRLS 1 PODCAST, we typically cover online communities that make a positive impact on the internet through their creativity or inclusivity. But not all digital watercoolers are a force for good.
The_Donald is a now-banned subreddit that was home to some of the former president's most passionate supporters. That, in itself, is barely interesting.
What boggles the mind is how this community rocketed disinformation into mainstream discourse, helped organize the January 6 insurrection, and tore gaping vulnerabilities into the U.S. administration.
This week, Alli and Jen talk with Alex Thomas, a journalist who has studied The_Donald for years (in its various incarnations) and written extensively about the unprecedented ways the president's own staff leveraged this fringe group to legitimize propaganda and sow the seeds of insurrection — moves which inadvertently left the administration vulnerable to Russian and Iranian trolls.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 111 @MugJerry and the Quest for Instagram Justice (December 8, 2019)</title>
      <description>We've got some great new episodes in the pipeline for you, but while we wait, here's an encore of one of our favorites, originally published on December 8, 2019.
-Original Notes-
The Instagram account turned multi-million dollar media company @FuckJerry is notorious for stealing funny tweets, memes, and other content from creators, and posting them — without credit or compensation — to their own social accounts. Fuck Jerry's following has exploded in recent years (14.5 million Instagram followers at the time of publication), but so has the backlash. The #FuckFuckJerry movement became an anti-piracy rallying cry across the Internet. Two comedians (Davram Stiefler and Jason Selvig) known as The Good Liars, have taken the movement a step further by creating @MugJerry, an Instagram account that steals back the stolen content from Fuck Jerry, then contacts the original creators to pay them for their tweet, joke, or photo.
Alli and Jen chat with The Good Liars about their mission of social media justice, the time they walked into Fuck Jerry's NYC offices and stole an actual mug, and the other ways they've created social commentary through comedy.

      <title>162 Something Awful</title>
      <description>Since 1999, the website Something Awful has been an Internet culture tastemaker, and this closed community is still going strong two decades later — a rarity for online platforms. Many modern memes and web culture references have their roots on Something Awful's humor forums.
For a one time fee of $10, you get full access to the site's vibrant discussion and community. That nominal barrier-to-entry is the secret to keeping the discourse quality high and shitpost ratios low, according to the site's current owner, who goes by the pseudonym Jeffrey of Yospos.
Paying for high-quality content and meaningful online community has recently come back into fashion amid the chaos of free platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which make money at incredible scale by selling user data to advertisers. It begs the question: Did we build the Internet wrong?
Alli and Jen talk with Jeffrey about the early days of Something Awful, a place where you're "free to be an Internet weirdo." We also learn the origins of "Let's Play" video game culture, and ways the SA community fought hate speech long before most platforms took it seriously.

Alli and Jen talk with Jeffrey about the early days of Something Awful, a place where you're "free to be an Internet weirdo." We also learn the origins of "Let's Play" video game culture, and ways the SA community fought hate speech long before most platforms took it seriously.

      <title>161 Buy Nothing</title>
      <description>Want to save money, help your neighbors, and create less waste all at the same time? The Internet can help. Specifically, the "Buy Nothing" communities that have sprouted up in thousands of cities and towns around the world. Usually, they operate within Facebook groups, where people post things they want to get rid of, and neighbors can claim them.
Alli and Jen speak with Marina Milosevic, the admin of the Santa Monica, CA Buy Nothing group, about the origins of the movement, managing a community that occasionally gets too large, the weirdest stuff people give away, and why it's easier than you think to stop buying things from Amazon.

      <title>160 How the Internet Is Changing Language (with Linguist Gretchen McCulloch)</title>
      <description>If you're concerned that LOLspeak and text messages are ruining language, fear not, grammar nerds! This week, Alli and Jen speak with linguist, author, and fellow podcaster Gretchen McCulloch, who says we are living in a special time for informal written language.
McCulloch explains why the Internet is changing language and culture in unprecedented ways, how regular people solved the 500-year-long quest for written sarcasm, and why post cards from George Harrison look like your dad's text messages.

      <title>159 Blasphemy Fetishes</title>
      <description>It won't shock most psychologists (armchair or professional) that figures of authority and oppression in early childhood can lead to kinks in adulthood. Look no further than blasphemy porn to bear out that theory.
This week, Alli and Jen talk with Sabrina Bea, a blasphemy fetish cam model who specializes in tearing up bibles and dressing as nuns. Sabrina tells us why her clientele are searching for this highly specific content, and why they'll pay big bucks for it. Also, the most common (and strangest) requests she gets online.

      <title>158 COVID Long Haulers</title>
      <description>The media tends to present 2 kinds of COVID-19 patients: Those who make a full recovery, and those who die.
But there's a massive group of people who suffer long term symptoms like months-long fevers, hair loss, and respiratory issues. And when they asked their doctors what was wrong, they got no answers.
So these COVID "Long Haulers" have turned to Facebook groups to share their experiences, get advice, and pool the wisdom that medicine is only beginning to understand.
Alli and Jen talk with Michele, the admin of a COVID-19 Long Haulers Facebook group, about the massive community that's grown around the long term symptoms of the pandemic.
She shares important stories that are often overlooked, the best ways to support and protect others, and the medical breakthroughs that have come out of this online community.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 113 ClausNet: The Social Network for Santas (December 22, 2019)</title>
      <description>It's been a busy week, so we're sharing one of our favorites to get you in the holiday spirit. We'll be back next week with more fun!
-Originally Published December 22, 2019-
Portraying Santa Claus in the modern era takes a village. What's the best way to whiten your eyebrows? Growing a beard, or applying one? How jolly is too jolly?
That's where ClausNet comes in. It's a social network, online forum, marketplace, and community where Santa performers can trade tips, tell stories, and learn the best ways to communicate with excited kids.
Michael Rielly has been portraying Santa Claus since he was 12 years old, and founded ClausNet in 2007 after identifying a strong need for online Santa resources and camaraderie. Rielly shares his personal tales of playing Santa, the evolution of ClausNet, and we're visited by a VERY special additional guest...

      <title>156 4chan: The Birthplace of All Memes</title>
      <description>4chan is often maligned by the media and mainstream culture as a hive of hate speech and hackers, but it's far more complex. 4chan culture is unique for its anonymity, ephemeral content, and un-challenged free speech, which often birth viral memes and hilarious crusades weeks before they reach Reddit or Facebook. 4chan's ability to mobilize real-world action against injustices like animal and child cruelty is also well documented. So how does this massively popular message board tick in a world where so much of the Internet has moved on to slick apps and personal profiles?
Alli and Jen talk with Brendan, an avid 4chan user who has been part of the site's culture since 2012. He explains why free speech is its most important value, its users' various social justice crusades, irony in a world of anonymity, why supporting Trump was mostly for the lulz, and why gender doesn't matter when you're an anonymous wall of text.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 94 Sweepers (Originally Published July 2019)</title>
      <description>Happy Thanksgiving! We're taking a breather this week and re-sharing another one of our favorites, this one originally published in July of 2019. We hope you enjoy!
-Original Notes-
Tom has been to the Super Bowl multiple times. He goes on free cruises yearly, has ridden on the Daytona 500 track at 200 miles per hour, traveled with the U.S. soccer team, and devoted a room of his house to store all the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and big screen TVs he's won over the years. That's because he enters more than 100 sweepstakes every single day, and thanks to a constant supply of free gift cards, he rarely pays for gas, cable, or his cell phone out of pocket. But he's not a wizard or a scammer. He's a Sweeper, and he's built a community of like-minded folks who share sweepstakes knowledge from around the country to beat the odds and get free stuff. Alli and Jen get his tips on how to win, and learn about his journey from free fries at Burger King in the '80s to running a sweeper newsletter at iwincontests.com.

      <title>155 Modern Families Are Easier to Make Thanks to the Internet</title>
      <description>21st century families come in all shapes and sizes. And while dating apps have helped people from all different backgrounds and locations get together, there hasn't been an online system in place for non-romantic coupling, specifically for the surrogacy, platonic co-parenting, and other family structures.
That's where Modamily joined the "matching app" ecosystem. As the CEO Ivan Fatovic explains, it came out of a dinner conversation among single women who hadn't found their life partner yet, but were worried about the ticking biological clock.
Fatovic tells Alli and Jen how Modamily works, the complexities of non-traditional family strucutres, and the success stories that have come out of his "non-dating app."

      <title>154 Financial Domination (Allie Eve Knox Returns!)</title>
      <description>Professional dominatrix and cam model Allie Eve Knox returns to discuss her particular area of expertise, Financial Domination (aka FinDom), the fetish where clients want to be told what to do with their money. But contrary to popular belief, it's not all about wasting your client's cash. In fact, Knox explains why a more sustainable approach to financial domination works out best for everyone involved. Think of it more as financial planning — with a lot more nudity.
Knox shares how she got started in FinDom, why it's one of the most profitable fetishes, and why it takes so much work to be an adult content creator.

      <itunes:subtitle>More like sustainable capitalism.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Professional dominatrix and cam model Allie Eve Knox returns to discuss her particular area of expertise, Financial Domination (aka FinDom), the fetish where clients want to be told what to do with their money. But contrary to popular belief, it's not all about wasting your client's cash. In fact, Knox explains why a more sustainable approach to financial domination works out best for everyone involved. Think of it more as financial planning — with a lot more nudity.
Knox shares how she got started in FinDom, why it's one of the most profitable fetishes, and why it takes so much work to be an adult content creator.

      <title>152 Political Humiliation with Empress Delfina</title>
      <description>Domination and humiliation aren't new in the world of fetishes, but one online sex worker has found a particularly compelling niche: Shaming and belittling Trump supporters to change their votes to Biden.
Empress Delfina has a multitude of clients who get off on being told how wrong they are to support the current administration — and she thinks the trend is growing.
Alli and Jen chat with the Empress about how she's "sex banking" for Biden, one orgasm at a time.

      <title>151 Why Tech Companies Won't Let You Fix Your Own Stuff (Steve Porter, TronicsFix)</title>
      <description>Back in the day, if your computer or an appliance broke down, you could pop open the case, unscrew the faulty part, and order a replacement from the manufacturer for a few dollars.
But increasingly, companies are more secretive about their proprietary tech. They keep their parts and schematics hidden, and when your iPhone or tractor breaks down, you’re forced to pay exorbitant repair costs, or worse — throw it away and buy the latest model.
It’s bad for the consumer, and it’s bad for the environment. But it’s big business for tech companies and manufacturers.
But for years, advocates of the Right to Repair movement have been sharing knowledge about the devices we use every day, and creating a wealth of online content to help people fix their own stuff for free or cheap.
Alli and Jen talk with Steve Porter, a lifelong “fixer” who has built a professional repair business and a thriving YouTube channel where he teaches his 700,000 subscribers how to repair video game consoles, phones, and retro tech. Porter shares the inspiration for TronicsFix, how he makes money buying broken tech, and his involvement in the Right to Repair movement, which is pushing to change repair laws to protect consumers.

      <title>150 Virtual Funeral Services (Gathering Us)</title>
      <description>Grief is never easy, but it's especially hard if you can't be with your loved ones in person. COVID-19 has made funerals incredibly complicated in recent months, but the online service Gathering Us has been planning for this for a while.
Its founder, Noha Waibsnaider, explains why virtual memorials are the next-best thing (and in some cases, even better than in-person events). Waibsnaider chats with Alli and Jen about the origins of Gathering Us, and the complexities of grieving over Zoom.

      <title>149 QAnon Casualties: How to Save a Loved One From Conspiracy Cults</title>
      <description>The Internet empowers everyone to find a like-minded community online. It also facilitates misinformation and conspiracy thinking at breakneck speeds. QAnon, the belief that government insiders have foretold the Biblical cleansing of liberals, has morphed from a handful of conspiracy theories on 8chan to a full-blown cult that is tearing families apart.
In response, the Internet has birthed support groups like r/QAnonCasualties, where people can share their stories and get advice on how to help family members obsessed with Q. It also contains the cautionary tales of former Q believers who found a way out.
In this special 4-part episode, Alli and Jen learn about the QAnon phenomenon, and what people can do to help loved ones unplug and escape from cult behavior.

Mike Rothschild, a journalist with The Daily Dot who has covered QAnon extensively. Mike explains its origins, evolution, and just how deep the Q rabbit hole goes (yes, aliens).

Mia, a woman who rebooted her life after her ex-husband became obsessed with Q.

Jitarth Jadeja, a former QAnon believer who left the cult after a lot of reflection and mental health support.

Rick Alan Ross, a cult deprogrammer, anti-cult activist, and author who has been helping families with cult intervention for decades.

<li>Mike Rothschild, a journalist with The Daily Dot who has covered QAnon extensively. Mike explains its origins, evolution, and just how deep the Q rabbit hole goes (yes, aliens).</li>
<li>Mia, a woman who rebooted her life after her ex-husband became obsessed with Q.</li>
<li>Jitarth Jadeja, a former QAnon believer who left the cult after a lot of reflection and mental health support.</li>
<li>Rick Alan Ross, a cult deprogrammer, anti-cult activist, and author who has been helping families with cult intervention for decades.</li>

      <title>[Encore Episode] 55 How Composer Kevin MacLeod Makes a Living Giving All His Music Away For Free (Originally Published October 22, 2018)</title>
      <description>We're working on something big for next week, so here's another one of our favorite encore episodes from back in the day.
Original Notes:
If you've ever sought a soundtrack for your home movies that wouldn't get removed by YouTube, chances are you've come across Kevin MacLeod's music. He's composed thousands of original tracks, in every imaginable genre, that he gives away under a Creative Commons license, on a variety of platforms, absolutely free. His music has been used in commercials, films, video games, and an uncountable number of YouTube videos and podcasts without any compensation. So, how does Kevin feed himself? Alli and Jen untangle the livelihood of the internet's most prolific composer and Creative Commons pioneer.

      <title>148 Unnecessary Inventions</title>
      <description>Matty Benedetto is a product designer by training, but his sense of humor led him to a life of hilarious content creation instead.
Benedetto builds Unnecessary Inventions, ingenious products that solve urgent problems you don’t actually have — like a drink holder for your shoe, or an alarm clock that snoozes itself so you won’t be bothered in the morning. His fake products (and their crisp photos and videos) are so popular that he’s garnered 4 million followers across social media, and a vast community of invention enthusiasts who either really want to buy these ridiculous items, or can’t stop suggesting bad inventions. Alli and Jen talk to Benedetto about where his weekly inspiration comes from, why it’s so hard to think of a problem that doesn’t exist, and what happens when real brands get involved in the fake product business.

      <title>147 One In an ARMY (BTS / K-Pop Fandom Charity)</title>
      <description>Global K-pop music sensation BTS’ charity efforts with Unicef and other foundations has empowered fans to make positive change in the world.
The BTS fandom is known as an “ARMY,” and the global volunteer collective One In an ARMY has become an engine of charitable giving, cause awareness, and social change.
When One In an ARMY mobilizes for a cause, K-pop stans flood social media with micro-donations and hashtags, raising thousands of dollars for the Syrian refugee crisis, Iraqi civilians, coral reef preservation, and the Black Lives Matter movement.
In all, they’ve raised more than $2 million for “actionable causes” — organizations that turn donations into tangible results. The fandom is so powerful that it often overwhelms charitable organizations, breaks non-profit websites (in a good way!), and swoops in to solve problems even governments are unable (or unwilling) to address.
This week, Alli and Jen talk with Erika, an admin from One In an ARMY, about how a fan community became a massive non-profit operation, and why the BTS singers themselves are key in turning their fandom toward important causes.

      <title>146 Solo Female Traveler Network</title>
      <description>While traveling alone in Mexico, Amanda Black was robbed. She felt violated, scared, and didn't know where to turn in a foreign county with no friends or family. That's when she realized the need for an online support network -- a place where women traveling alone can get advice, and in some cases, urgent help.
She founded the Solo Female Traveler Network in 2016, and thousands of women joined immediately, sharing similar stories of vulnerability. Today, the Facebook group and website count more than 420,000 members, and it's become a place of empowerment for women traveling the globe.
Alli and Jen talk to Black about the unique challenges women face when traveling, the discouraging responses from friends and family when women decide to travel, and some amazing stories of how this online community saved the day in an IRL crisis.

      <title>145 Get a Pen Pal</title>
      <description>Email, texting, and social media have made our world smaller. But have we lost something in the age of instant messages?
Maksim Jovovic created the website Get A Pen Pal, a place to match with someone interesting from anywhere in the world and engage in slow, deliberate letter-writing. Sure, the communication is still digital, but these "letters" take days to go back and forth, use collectible stamps, and encourage rich communication, rather than just, "sup?"
Alli and Jen ask Jovovic about his inspiration for the site, the community that's growing there, and why now is the perfect time to rekindle the magic of corresponding with pen pals.

      <title>144 What Makes a Great Online Community?</title>
      <description>Online communities (sometimes the only communities we have during a pandemic) can be magical places. Friendships forged, insights shared, and fun had by all. They can also become toxic, shouty cesspools. Why do some succeed while others devolve into chaos?
Alli and Jen talk with Anika Gupta, a journalist who studied online community structures for her book How to Handle a Crowd: The Art of Creating Healthy and Dynamic Online Communities.
Gupta shares the key to healthy moderation, the social norms of different platforms, why scale makes things complicated, and what online platforms can do to help communities thrive and protect vulnerable members.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 46 The Women Editing Thousands of Wikipedia Articles in a Quest for Gender Parity (Originally Published Aug 20, 2018)</title>
      <description>This episode was originally published on August 20, 2018 (2 years ago, whoa!)
For countless historical and social reasons, most of the people editing Wikipedia are white men. This has led to broad bias across the world's de facto repository of online knowledge. But a loose affiliation of women are making up the ground by writing and editing the biographies of historically significant women and minorities who might otherwise be overlooked by academic or popular culture. Alli and Jen speak with Rosie Stephenson Goodknight, a lauded Wikipedian with more than 4000 articles to her credit.

      <title>143 The space cemetery in 'EVE Online'</title>
      <description>Alli and Jen speak with Jason Marshall, a veteran player of the MMO 'EVE Online' about the game's 15-year-old player-run space graveyard.
The Molea cemetery has been operating since 2004, and not only contains the frozen corpses of killed space pilots, but graves that mark the deaths of lost loved ones in real life — friends, family members, pets, and other players.
In June of this year, the developers of 'EVE' formally recognized this player accomplishment by adding a massive, permanent memorial to the system. Marshall explains how the cemetery got started, why players care so much about transporting their clone corpses to virtual graves, how the team fended off attacks from the notorious Goonswarm Alliance, and the first time a player requested a grave for a real person.

      <title>142 How Does Wikipedia Actually Work?</title>
      <description>We all use Wikipedia on a daily basis, but do you really know how humanity’s largest organized body of knowledge gets made? Alli and Jen talk with Bill Beutler, a longtime Wikipedia editor and the author of The Wikipedian, a blog about Wikipedia culture. He’s also the CEO of Beutler Ink, a consultancy which advises clients and public figures on the ethical way to address inaccuracies on Wikipedia.
Beutler explains the dynamic and rigorous process that happens behind the scenes of controversial Wikipedia articles, how Wikipedians are handling information about COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter, the ever-present specter of bias, and how the entire Internet would be different if Wikipedia operated as a for-profit company.

      <title>141 The Church of Universal Suffrage</title>
      <description>Alli and Jen speak with Tim Jacobs, the founding minister of The Church of Universal Suffrage, a legally recognized religion that hosts “weekly meditation on the nature of voter suppression,” and observes every voting day in the U.S. as a religious holiday, which — legally speaking — affords church members some handy privileges, like the right to take the day off from work.
Jacobs explains how the church was inspired by a Reddit discussion about several states stifling vote-by-mail efforts. Since then, the non-profit organization has spread to all 50 states and many countries around the world, with all of its holy worship done online through community and voter advocacy efforts. We also discuss how easy it is to create a real religion in the U.S., why we don’t celebrate voting enough, and how you can get involved to ensure your friends, neighbors and community have access to the vote.

      <title>140 Flea Market Flippers (With Rob &amp; Melissa Stephenson)</title>
      <description>eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Mercari, Craigslist ... there's no shortage of apps to buy and sell random stuff.
But if you live and breathe these marketplaces, you can identify opportunities to buy low and sell high. What starts as an exhilarating hobby can turn into a full-time job if you know what you're doing.
That's how Rob and Melissa Stephenson make their living. By leveraging their knowledge of certain product categories (home exercise equipment, heavy machinery) and tapping into the internet's 24/7 global marketpalce, they've been able to "flip" a wide variety of items, often for 10-20x profit.
Rob and Melissa join Alli and Jen to discuss their journey from a work-a-day family to full-time flippers making six figures from the comfort of their smartphones. They share practical advice on how to get started, the rise of the flipping community, and the explosive market demand while everyone's stuck at home during a pandemic.

      <title>139 "Darknet Diaries" with Jack Rhysider</title>
      <description>Alli and Jen talk with Jack Rhysider, the creator and host of the hit podcast Darknet Diaries which tells “true stories from the dark side of the Internet.”
Or as Matt likes to call it, This American Life for hackers.
Rhysider worked in information security (infosec) and was searching for a podcast that tells the stories of hackers and digital heists. It didn’t exist, so he made his own. These days, thousands of listeners love his meticulously crafted stories about penetration testers, video game hacks gone very wrong, and how digital activists take down the corporations and politicians they despise.
Rhysider tells us about the fascinating worlds of botnet rentals, discount internet pizza, ’90s Web art, and drone warfare over Chinese pig farms.

      <title>138 "Animal Talking" with Gary Whitta</title>
      <description>Screenwriter and games journalist Gary Whitta joins Alli and Jen to talk about his experimental late night celebrity talk show "Animal Talking," which is live-streamed entirely inside of Nintendo's "Animal Crossing: New Horizons," and why a world in quarantine can't stop watching.
Whitta discusses the show's impromptu beginnings, its technical complexity, what it's like sitting on a virtual couch with Elijah Wood and Danny Trejo, and what happens when Sting wants to be on your "Animal Crossing" show, but doesn't own a Nintendo Switch.

      <title>[Encore Episode] 54 Tay Zonday (Originally Published October 15, 2018)</title>
      <description>Matt is still on vacation, but we have a great encore episode for you. How Tay Zonday survived being 'Patient Zero' of viral YouTube.
Originally Published: October 15, 2018
Way back in 2007 Tay Zonday uploaded the original song "Chocolate Rain" to YouTube, and nothing happened. Then Digg and 4chan found it. And then Zonday was on CNN and Jimmy Kimmel trying to explain his music on national television. His meteoric rise led to a 10-year journey of identity confusion, and eventually self-actualization. Alli and Jen have a long, deep talk with Tay about coping with viral fame and his new podcast about that very topic, called "Chocolate Pains."

      <title>[Encore Episode] 87 Birds of North America (Originally Published June 10, 2019)</title>
      <description>Matt is on vacation this week, so we're re-sharing one of our favorites from last year. Enjoy!
Bird watching probably conjures images of an old, retired guy sporting binoculars behind his country home. But Jason Ward is rapidly dispelling that stereotype. He's been an avid birder since his childhood growing up in The Bronx, NY, and has brought his passion to social media. His #TrickyBirdID Twitter threads challenge people to snap photos of unknown neighborhood birds so the global community of birders can identify them. His enthusiasm led him to make the popular webseries Birds of North America with Topic, where viewers can follow Ward on his adventures in urban birding. The beautiful and informative show proves that cities are in fact a great place for bird watchers, and that the hobby is an accessible way for everyone to reconnect with nature, regardless of class, color, or location. Alli and Jen talk to Ward about his love of birds, his journey from enthusiast to science communicator, his trepidation about making a show, and the modern tech that makes bird watching in 2019 so much fun.

      <title>137 Second Life Sex Workers</title>
      <description>Cybersex is as old as the Internet itself. But as virtual spaces become more sophisticated, so too has sex work. Second Life is more of a "technology playground" than a video game -- a place where your digital skills can be traded for real money. Many players make a healthy living by providing custom goods or services, including sex work.
This week, Alli and Jen speak with Meela Vanderbuilt, the creator and owner of The Mondarchy, the most expensive brothel in Second Life. She's also joined by Reyna, the club's general staff manager. Together, they explain the culture of Second Life (which began way back in 2003), why Meela's brown-skinned avatar was rejected by other clubs. the inspiration for starting her own, and how sex work...works in a virtual world.
Special thanks to Quintin Smith for help with this episode. His outstanding video about The Monarchy and Meela's story can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR94zlsHFdc

      <title>135 Cheap Old Houses</title>
      <description>Alli and Jen talk with Elizabeth Finkelstein, a preservation expert and the creator of Cheap Old Houses, a wildly popular Instagram account that shows the dream of home ownership may not be as hard as we think, depending on your priorities.
Finkelstein explains the inspiration for the account, her love of DIY home repair, the history carried in old houses (and why we should preserve them), the passionate community around Cheap Old Houses, and whether internet-powered jobs can save the middle class from the real estate squeeze.

      <title>134 WeRateDogs (@dog_rates / Matt Nelson)</title>
      <description>With more than 14 million followers across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, WeRateDogs is on a mission that everyone on planet Earth can get behind: Rating cute doggos from the internet on a (dubious!) 10-point scale.
This blend of adorable dog pics, comedic captions, and obsessive fan-submitted content has catapulted the novelty account (and its creator, Matt Nelson) into a massive online brand, which uses its influence to entertain millions, sell merch, and help dogs in need.
Alli and Jen talk with Nelson about the inspiration for the account, how its explosive popularity changed his life, the serious inflation problem in the Dog Rating Economy, that time J.K. Rowling and Lin-Manuel Miranda followed him, why everything's political on Twitter, and his perfect response when Arnold Schwarzenegger asked him to rate his donkeys.

      <title>133 A Group Where We All Pretend to Be Ants in an Ant Colony</title>
      <description>On the Internet, nobody knows if you're a dog. Or, an ant for that matter. And there are nearly 2 million people, all working together, pretending to be ants in a giant ant colony, in one special Facebook group.
"A group where we all pretend to be ants in an ant colony" has exploded in popularity thanks to its imaginative premise, and because honestly what else are you going to do in quarantine? Also: Ants are cool AF.
Alli and Jen talk with Sydney Malloy, one of the group's top "Ant-mins," about what it takes to keep 2 million "ants" in line on Facebook, why ants are awesome, and the joy of collaborative pretending online.

      <title>132 Online Standup Comedy With Josh Gondelman</title>
      <description>There's a lot to laugh at on the Internet, but standup comedy — a distinctly in-person art form — is facing challenges in a time of self-isolation. But "virtual" comedy clubs, powered by Zoom, Twitch, and YouTube, are increasingly popping up in quarantine. But as expected, the tight 5 that kills on stage may need adjustments for an audience that can only laugh in emojis.
This week, Alli and Jen talk to standup comedian and writer/producer Josh Gondelman about how the standup world is adapting to the Internet, what makes a set work online, and the difference between IRL and virtual heckling.

      <title>131 Dating in 'Animal Crossing'</title>
      <description>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has taken over the world in self-isolation, and become a virtual place of normalcy, even for non-gamers. But what if you’re single and dating, but can’t leave the house due to lockdowns? Tom Nook, in his infinite wisdom, has a solution for that.
Alli and Jen talk with Lady Brittany, a Twitch streamer who has converted her entire Animal Crossing domain into a Love Island, optimized for romance and photo ops around every corner. There, she hosts real dates and even wedding ceremonies, which can’t take place IRL due to COVID-19. And while she typically livestreams her island activities, she also takes the privacy of visiting couples very seriously. Brittany shares the inspiration for her mermaid-themed getaway, the special events she holds for her community, and why Animal Crossing is such a special and important game — especially now.

      <itunes:subtitle>IRL dating is off limits, but this "Love Island" is open.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has taken over the world in self-isolation, and become a virtual place of normalcy, even for non-gamers. But what if you’re single and dating, but can’t leave the house due to lockdowns? Tom Nook, in his infinite wisdom, has a solution for that.
Alli and Jen talk with Lady Brittany, a Twitch streamer who has converted her entire Animal Crossing domain into a Love Island, optimized for romance and photo ops around every corner. There, she hosts real dates and even wedding ceremonies, which can’t take place IRL due to COVID-19. And while she typically livestreams her island activities, she also takes the privacy of visiting couples very seriously. Brittany shares the inspiration for her mermaid-themed getaway, the special events she holds for her community, and why Animal Crossing is such a special and important game — especially now.

      <title>130 Building College Campuses in Minecraft</title>
      <description>College classes and graduations around the world are being canceled or administered remotely, but many enterprising students have taken to the virtual spaces of Minecraft to painstakingly recreate their campuses in amazing detail. While you can't walk down the main streets of Boston University and UPenn in real life, you can visit them virtually inside the blocky servers built by their students and faculty.
Alli and Jen talk with students and volunteer builders Pearse Anderson, Nick Marchuk, and Makarios Chung about why the Minecraft community is so powerful in a time of social distance, why video game worlds are better than Zoom calls, and their virtual graduation plans.

      <title>129 Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens</title>
      <description>More than 600,000 people (mostly college students) are using a Facebook group to come together and bond over how bad taking classes on Zoom is. This week, Alli and Jen talk to Zana Rashid, a moderator from Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens, a place for humor in a time of isolation.
Rashid shares how disruptive COVID-19 has been for university students, the power of funny memes during this difficult time, and the Boomer vs. Zoomer wars that constantly erupt within this growing community.

      <title>128 Medical Fetishes (MedFet)</title>
      <description>Amid worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment (medical PPE), someone at the UK's National Health Service reached out to the medical fetish retailer MedFetUK, hoping to find a stock of masks or scrubs. MedFetUK immediately delivered, donating their entire supply (usually sold for sex play) to a hospital. While Justin, the co-founder of the company, says it was obviously "the right thing to do," thousands on Twitter quickly gathered round to cheer the small fetish company, and also collectively wonder: What *is* a medical fetish, anyway?
This week, Alli and Jen talk to Justin about the diverse world of MedFet, its roots in BDSM, the variety of equipment used in role play (including needles!), and whether the current pandemic is affecting the community.
Check out MedFetUK for all your MedFet needs! https://medfetuk.com/
Read Justin's tweet, and the hilarious replies: https://twitter.com/MedFet_UK/status/1243590308878848002

      <title>127 The Spot: 1995's Online Reality Show</title>
      <description>In 1995, at the height of cultural mania around 90210, Melrose Place, and MTV's The Real World, the Internet as we know it today was just getting started. But if you had a connection and thirsted for more beautiful people trapped in a house with drama, there was The Spot. Created by producer Scott Zakarin, it was a first-of-its kind interactive webseries that imagined a cast of young, attractive characters writing journal entries about their lives inside a shared beach house in California. Diaries, pictures, and short video clips kept the audience up to date, and devoted fans (some who assumed it was real) could write in by email to influence the characters and plot. Today, we take this kind of interactive media for granted.The Spot was incredibly innovative for its time, and engaged a rabid fanbase while simultaneously baffling mainstream media.
Alli and Jen chat with Zakarin about his inspiration for the show, what kind of plot points create the best drama, and why dogs are always able to write journal entries in his projects. He also shares details of his current obsession, a new podcast called Digital Sky, available on all podcast platforms, and YouTube.

      <title>125 Chris Dancy, The Mindful Cyborg</title>
      <description>In 2008, database engineer Chris Dancy weighed 320 pounds, smoked two packs and drank 36 cans of Diet Coke every day. He was being paid a lot of money to be — in his words — “a real pile of shit.”
But as modern social media began taking shape, Dancy noticed how the things he posted online correlated with how he felt — and therefore, how he acted.
He began to track everything he did: foods he ate, shows he binge-watched, and people he interacted with online. He wrote programs that automatically uploaded these habits to a Google Calendar.
In time, he drew correlations between his actions and the resulting behavior. This lead to automated systems, powered by 700 sensors and applications, that reinforced good habits (like exercise and gratitude) instead of bad ones.
The results were dramatic. He lost 120 lbs., kicked the smoking and soda habits, and left his regimen of anti-depressants behind.
Dancy is now an author and public speaker who inspires people to take control of the data that corporations are using to track and advertise bad habits to you, and put it to work to improve your life.
In this week’s episode of 2 GIRLS 1 PODCAST, Alli and Jen talk to Dancy about his latest project to help communities cope with COVID-19, the simple systems he created to build gratitude into his daily life, how he earned the title of “Most Connected Man on Earth,” why limiting screen time is bullshit, and the lessons from his book Don’t Unplug: How Technology Saved My Life and Can Save Yours Too.

      <title>124 Biohackers</title>
      <description>There are two types of "biohackers" in this world: People who are optimizing their bodies for peak performance, and...cyborgs.
The cyborgs are putting microchips, magnets, and even full, working computers inside their bodies. Why? Because it's the future. And these brave pioneers are willing to cut themselves open to see where humanity is headed.
Alli and Jen talk to Quinn Mooney, a biohacker with NFC chips in his hands and plans to install a Raspberry Pi in his leg. Mooney moderates the forums at biohacking.me and the r/biohackers subreddit, and explains the community's fascination with human augmentation, the open-source movement behind it all, and the medical and regulatory challenges that stand in the way of this personal experimentation.

      <title>123 What If YouTube Had Failed in 2006?</title>
      <description>An entire generation has grown up in a world where uploading hours of 4K video to the Internet is not only common, but expected. But, what if the legal and technological barriers that killed Napster and other file-sharing sites had also crushed YouTube? In 2006, despite its growing popularity, YouTube could easily have been wiped off the map by copyright battles and the skyrocketing cost of hosting humanity's video.
So, what would the Internet, its culture, and the world look like today if YouTube had failed? Adi Robertson, senior reporter at The Verge, has imagined just that in her alternate history of the Web. While mostly an entertaining thought experiment, Robertson's theories are rooted in "Web 1.5's" corporate landscape, and what was technologically possible at a time when putting video onto the Internet was no easy task.
Alli and Jen talk to Robertson about the inspiration for her piece, why education and politics would be different, the miracle that YouTube exists at all, and WTF a "mesh net" is.

      <title>122 Civ Battle Royale</title>
      <description>Sid Meier’s Civilization is a storied video game franchise built on an epic premise: Build a civilization to stand the test of time.
Typically, a player will control a historic civ — like China, France, India, or Rome — and manage every aspect of its culture, beginning in 4,000 BCE. Food, trade, technology, government civics, religion, population growth, colonial expansion, and of course the military, all become granular decisions with far-reaching effects on history. The game is played like a turn-based tabletop experience, often against AI-controlled opponents.
But what if the game was played only by AI? Years ago, members of the Civ community set up that exact experiment. 60 AI civilizations on a world map shaped like Earth, with one goal: to destroy each other at all costs.
What would play out with no human intervention? Which civ would win, and why? These questions kept fans glued to the game as it slowly unfolded across Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube.
Today, Civ Battle Royale has become a strategy game institution, and evolved into a seasonal “TV show” of sorts.
This week on 2 GIRLS 1 PODCAST, Alli and Jen speak with Steve Yanosky, who runs the current iteration of the Civ Battle Royale game on his home computer, and captures hours of video, screenshots, and data to update the community on what has unfolded in this epic, war-torn world of battling AI.
Yanosky explains the evolution of CBR across its three seasons, the community of fans and modders who make the experiment technically possible, and the fan art and data analysis that keep thousands of people rooting for their favorite historical leader.

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization</em> is a storied video game franchise built on an epic premise: Build a civilization to stand the test of time.</p><p>Typically, a player will control a historic civ — like China, France, India, or Rome — and manage every aspect of its culture, beginning in 4,000 BCE. Food, trade, technology, government civics, religion, population growth, colonial expansion, and of course the military, all become granular decisions with far-reaching effects on history. The game is played like a turn-based tabletop experience, often against AI-controlled opponents.</p><p>But what if the game was played <em>only</em> by AI? Years ago, members of the <em>Civ</em> community <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/civilization-v-42-ai-battle/">set up that exact experiment</a>. 60 AI civilizations on a world map shaped like Earth, with one goal: to destroy each other at all costs.</p><p>What would play out with no human intervention? Which civ would win, and why? These questions kept fans glued to the game as it slowly unfolded across Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube.</p><p>Today, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/"><em>Civ Battle Royale</em></a> has become a strategy game institution, and evolved into a seasonal “TV show” of sorts.</p><p>This week on <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/tags/2-girls-1-podcast/"><em>2 GIRLS 1 PODCAST</em></a>, Alli and Jen speak with Steve Yanosky, who runs the current iteration of the Civ Battle Royale game on his home computer, and captures hours of video, screenshots, and data to update the community on what has unfolded in this epic, war-torn world of battling AI.</p><p>Yanosky explains the evolution of <em>CBR</em> across its three seasons, the community of fans and modders who make the experiment technically possible, and the fan art and data analysis that keep thousands of people rooting for their favorite historical leader.</p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a>Join us on Discord: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Talk to Alli and Jen:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alligold">https://twitter.com/alligold</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/joonbugger">https://twitter.com/joonbugger</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>121 Gone Wild Audio</title>
      <description>Porn on Reddit should come as no surprise. But nearly 400,000 listeners subscribe to r/GoneWildAudio, a community for high quality, audio-only erotic vignettes. Creators there use high-end microphones to create specific, explicit, and often elaborate fantasies for listeners. The visuals are left entirely to the imagination, and the intimacy level is off the charts.
This week, Alli and Jen speak with Belle_in_the_woods, one of the most popular and prolific erotic audio creators on the subreddit. She explains how she comes up with her sexy scenarios, how creators and listeners collaborate, what a "ramblefap" is, and how she's turned her talents into a thriving side hustle of both erotic, and SFW audio production.

      <title>120 Genyus Network is a safe social space for stroke survivors</title>
      <description>Caleb Rixon was a 24-year-old musical theater actor in his prime, who had just landed a major role in a production of Chicago.
He hit the gym to prepare for a long tour of song and dance, when he felt something explode behind his eye during a workout class. He remembers being taken away in an ambulance and not much else. He woke up a month later, unable to walk, talk, or swallow. But he was alive.
A rare brain abnormality had caused a massive stroke, and Rixon was on a slow road to recovery. He wanted to meet other young stroke survivors like himself, but all the support groups were rife with medical jargon. So Rixon created his own support space on the internet — Genyus Network — where survivors could share their stories, not their symptoms.
This week on &lt;em&gt;2 GIRLS 1 PODCAST&lt;/em&gt;, Alli and Jen talk with Rixon about this life-altering condition, recovery, and how he turned his experience into a global network of powerful stories.

      <title>119 How one woman hacked online dating to find the perfect partner</title>
      <description>Quantitative futurist Amy Webb was fed up with online dating in 2005. The questionnaires and algorithms on sites like Match and OKcupid that were supposed to connect like-minded people and form lasting relationships yielded nothing but duds and disastrous dates.
Despite advice from family and friends to cast a wider net, Webb did the opposite: she became even more picky. She created a long list of dating criteria and narrowed the pool of singles down using a complex scoring system. Then, she used competitive data sets from other female profiles to optimize her own.
Through this “market research,” she inadvertently became the site’s most popular dating profile. Now, highly desirable and extremely picky, her data zeroed in on a single man from Baltimore.
Spoiler Alert: They are happily married with children to this day.
Alli and Jen talk with Webb about how she hacked dating algorithms to find the man of her dreams, the TED Talk and book about her experience that divided the internet, and the adorable (and nerve-wracking!) story of her final first date.

      <title>118 Sign Language Is Rapidly Evolving in VR</title>
      <description>Deaf users of immersive social platforms like VRchat can face a tough time communicating. Unlike other social media, VR spaces rely on verbal and physical communication rather than text. And sign language with current-gen VR controllers is limiting and clunky at best.
But groups of volunteer interpreters inside VR worlds are hard at work making sure these spaces are more welcoming and accessible for deaf users. The result is an empowering community of "Helping Hands."
This week, Alli and Jen speak with Quentin, a 19-year-old volunteer translator and VR enthusiast, who is bridging the communications gap between deaf and hearing people in VRchat. Quentin (a hearing person) shares how and why he learned American Sign Language, the tech limitations of signing in VR, and how sign language is evolving in VR to accommodate differences between headsets and motion tracking.

      <title>117 Urban Exploring</title>
      <description>Sneaking into abandoned buildings and filming urban decay may not be the newest trend, but obsession with so-called “urban exploring” and “abandon porn” has skyrocketed alongside the widespread accessibility of social media.
Today, millions of viewers eagerly await the videos of intrepid explorers like Bob Thissen, who travel the world in search of abandoned power plants, coal mines, theme parks, hotels, and shopping malls. Thissen’s mission is archaeological: to document places where no one has set foot in years (or decades), and tell the story of their abandonment through found objects.
Often, Thissen’s videos show meals half-eaten, clothes hanging in closets, and machinery in working order, left to rot for a variety of reasons: business failures, safety concerns, and even political revolutions.

      <title>116 The man who sold shares of himself on the Internet</title>
      <description>In 2008, Mike Merrill divided himself into 100,000 shares and offered them to the Internet for $1 a pop. After the initial wave of friends and family bought in, online strangers began to acquire shares of Mike⁠ — a regular person, not a company.
With those shares come voting rights. Shareholders were allowed to decide Merrill's diet, his romantic decisions, even whether or not to get a vasectomy. Any personal life decision for which Merrill would seek advice from a friend, he instead posed to shareholders, who would vote on legally binding decisions.
The experiment led him to global news coverage and an appearance on the Today Show, which raised the price of his shares significantly. These days, shares of Mike trade at around $5.
Alli and Jen talk to Merrill about the origins of the experiment, how crowdsourced decision making has shaped his life, and what he might do differently in the wake of newer online commodity trading models like Bitcoin.

      <title>115 Lissa Explains it All</title>
      <description>In 1997, an 11-year-old girl set up a website with HTML tutorials and guides for Neopets. Within a few years, "Lissa Explains it All" was serving 500,000 monthly visitors, its forums hosted 75.,000 users, and Google was sending her big fat ad revenue checks. Alyssa Daniels, a kid from Orlando, was teaching the world how to make websites long before YouTube tutorials and Squarespace — and making legit money in the process.
Alli and Jen talk to Daniels about her childhood entrepreneurial spirit, early Web culture, what her parents and friends thought of her startup business, '90s Nickelodeon shows, and what she's up to these days.
Lissa Explains it All still exists: http://www.lissaexplains.com
And Daniels now streams on Twitch! https://www.twitch.tv/Lyssatee

      <title>114 Smart Bitches, Trashy Books</title>
      <description>Romance novels get a bad rap, probably due to a history of stereotypical characters, plots, gender roles, and an all-around "trashy" look on supermarket and drug store shelves. But the genre has changed radically, and romance fiction now spans a wide variety of sub genres and writing styles. If you love romance, but not sure where to find the best authors and titles, start with Smart Bitches, Trashy Books, a community co-founded by Sarah Wendell nearly 15 years ago. The site (and podcast) is a social gathering hub that connects voracious romance readers with literature they love, and provides a safe space to gush with other fans.
Wendell talks with Alli and Jen about busting romance stereotypes, the power of the Smart Bitches community, and recommends great books for everyone's tastes.

      <title>113 ClausNet: The Social Network for Santas</title>
      <description>Portraying Santa Claus in the modern era takes a village. What's the best way to whiten your eyebrows? Growing a beard, or applying one? How jolly is too jolly?
That's where ClausNet comes in. It's a social network, online forum, marketplace, and community where Santa performers can trade tips, tell stories, and learn the best ways to communicate with excited kids.
Michael Rielly has been portraying Santa Claus since he was 12 years old, and founded ClausNet in 2007 after identifying a strong need for online Santa resources and camaraderie. Rielly shares his personal tales of playing Santa, the evolution of ClausNet, and we're visited by a VERY special additional guest...

      <title>112  The Cottage Industry of Custom VR Sex Avatars</title>
      <description>The rise of powerful, free 3D modeling software has emboldened a cottage industry of VR enthusiasts to create custom sex avatars for virtual porn. But what happens when members of this community start requesting models that look like celebrities, ex-girlfriends, classmates, and co-workers?
Samantha Cole covers VR and online sex for Vice, and her recent piece titled "They Can't Stop Us," chronicles the sometimes well-meaning but often seedy underbelly of a marketplace that trades in virtual belly buttons, boobs, and bespoke faces that VR pornographers can't get enough of.

      <title>111 @MugJerry and the Quest for Instagram Justice</title>
      <description>The Instagram account turned multi-million dollar media company @FuckJerry is notorious for stealing funny tweets, memes, and other content from creators, and posting them — without credit or compensation — to their own social accounts. Fuck Jerry's following has exploded in recent years (14.5 million Instagram followers at the time of publication), but so has the backlash. The #FuckFuckJerry movement became an anti-piracy rallying cry across the Internet. Two comedians (Davram Stiefler and Jason Selvig) known as The Good Liars, have taken the movement a step further by creating @MugJerry, an Instagram account that steals back the stolen content from Fuck Jerry, then contacts the original creators to pay them for their tweet, joke, or photo.
Alli and Jen chat with The Good Liars about their mission of social media justice, the time they walked into Fuck Jerry's NYC offices and stole an actual mug, and the other ways they've created social commentary through comedy.

      <title>109 The Teens of TikTok</title>
      <description>TikTok came on the social media scene relatively recently (2016), and teens have flocked to it. The Chinese-made lip-syncing video app boasts 500 million users, most of them young. TikTok has developed its own culture and communities within, and Rolling Stone writer EJ Dickson has been observing and reporting on them in detail. As a non-teen herself, she's fascinated by the empowerment and deep social awareness that appears baked-in to Gen-Z, thanks to their constant connectivity.
Alli and Jen talk to Dickson about her coverage of TikTok, the teen communities that form there, the trends of self-empowerment that run through the network, and the social media cesspools we can't seem to escape.

      <title>108 Virtual Reality Therapy Sessions</title>
      <description>The anonymity of the Internet has long made it a place for confessions and bonding with strangers you'll never meet IRL. Virtual reality kicks it up a notch. Social spaces like VRchat allow strangers to inhabit the same "room" and communicate vocally and with body language, two aspects that differentiate it from the chat rooms of yore. One VRchat user, Syrmor, has found the platform to be an extremely compelling place for soul-baring, therapeutic conversations. So much so, that people around the world now seek out his adorable cat avatar to have deep conversations about death, love, purpose, and abuse. Syrmor shares these incredibly intimate VR conversations on his YouTube channel, where millions watch and react to this phenomenon of "VR therapy."
Alli and Jen talk to Symror about how he became the "Dr. Phil" of VRchat, why VR is so conducive to intimacy, the conversations that never made it to his channel, and the future of social VR.

        <![CDATA[<p>The anonymity of the Internet has long made it a place for confessions and bonding with strangers you'll never meet IRL. Virtual reality kicks it up a notch. Social spaces like VRchat allow strangers to inhabit the same "room" and communicate vocally and with body language, two aspects that differentiate it from the chat rooms of yore. One VRchat user, Syrmor, has found the platform to be an extremely compelling place for soul-baring, therapeutic conversations. So much so, that people around the world now seek out his adorable cat avatar to have deep conversations about death, love, purpose, and abuse. Syrmor shares these incredibly intimate VR conversations on his YouTube channel, where millions watch and react to this phenomenon of "VR therapy."</p><p>Alli and Jen talk to Symror about how he became the "Dr. Phil" of VRchat, why VR is so conducive to intimacy, the conversations that never made it to his channel, and the future of social VR.</p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a>Join us on Discord: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Talk to Alli and Jen:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alligold">https://twitter.com/alligold</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/joonbugger">https://twitter.com/joonbugger</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>107 'World of Warcraft' Reunions</title>
      <description>When World of Warcraft came on the scene in 2004, it redefined the potential for massively multiplayer online (MMO) games. Players not only spent daily hours grinding for loot and gear, but socializing in a deep and organic way. Lifelong friendships and IRL marriages were forged in the flames of Azeroth.
As WoW and MMOs evolved, some players yearned for that simpler time. And with the recent release of World of Warcraft Classic, guild-mates and raiding parties who haven't played together in a decade are reconnecting. Longtime WoW fan Chris Price created a Discord server for players searching for old comrades. Little did he know it would become a hub for warriors and paladins around the world to reconnect with long lost in-game friends.
For any WoW players interested in joining the server or locating Price's guild:
WoW Reunion Discord: https://discord.gg/EyedZV
Price's In-Game Name: Valandil (Alliance)
Wow Server: Grobbulus: (RP, PvP)

      <title>106 Deepfakes (with Sham00k)</title>
      <description>Deep fakes, a process that uses AI and machine learning to place someone’s face on another’s body with Hollywood-level results, have been entertaining and terrifying the Internet for the last few years. And the technology is advancing exponentially, according to Sham00k, a programmer and popular deep fake artist who recently transformed impressionist Jim Meskimen into the 20 different celebrities he’s impersonating.
But with this great power comes great responsibility. What do deep fakes mean for the future of entertainment, media literacy, politics, and porn?
Alli and Jen talk to Sham00k about his process, the rapidly improving tech, and where he sees the trend heading in 5-10 years.

      <description>We're taking the week off due to unforeseen scheduling mishaps, but wanted to share one of our favorite classic episodes that longtime listeners and new fans may not have heard. It's our very first published episode about the Furry community, which came to define the mission of the show, and set the tone for future episodes. We hope you enjoy, and we'll talk at you next week!
Original Description:
Alli and Jen speak with Dominic Rodriguez, director of the documentary Fursonas, about life (and sex) as an anthropomorphic animal. Also: Why are overall hooks only sold in large quantities?

      <title>105 Virtual Reality: Sex, Marriage, and the Future of Relationships</title>
      <description>Virtual reality might still be for early adopters, but as headsets get smaller and social norms evolve, more people are meeting, hanging out, having sex, and even getting married in virtual spaces.
Peter Rubin is a VR expert, author, and senior correspondent at Wired, where he covers VR social spaces. And while people have been socializing and getting kinky online for decades, Rubin believes that "embodied presence" (truly feeling that your body is physically next to another person in VR) is a breakthrough that differentiates VR spaces like Rec Room and VRchat, and will change interpersonal communication as the technology gets better and cheaper.
Alli and Jen talk to Rubin about VR platform culture, a couple that got married in VR, emerging tech that will soon let us touch and smell in VR, and the future of virtual sex.

      <title>104 One Red Paperclip (Kyle MacDonald)</title>
      <description>In 2005, Canadian blogger Kyle MacDonald traded a red paperclip for a fish-shaped pen. From there, he wanted to see how many times he could "trade up" for something bigger and better. After one year and 14 trades (facilitated by the Internet, of course), he acquired a two-story farmhouse in Saskatchewan. No money changed hands. The barter-only experiment became a viral sensation and presents deep thoughts about the nature of value. Alli and Jen talk to MacDonald about his inspiration for the project, the amazing and strange people he met along the way, how the fame has affected his life, and the businesses who are still trying to cash in on Red Paperclip mania.

      <title>103 Selling $80 Used Tissues on the Internet</title>
      <description>Stand-up comedian Mekki Leeper wanted to see if he could convince the Internet to buy a fake wellness product. With some slick branding, fake Instagram followers, and the perfect media outrage hook, Leeper turned a Squarespace website and $1,000 into global demand for $80 used tissues. Vaev tissues claimed to get you sick today, so you'd be inoculated later. And people were willing to pay big bucks for these chic snot rags.
The viral success of this fake health product (akin to Goop and Raw Water) lead to a Comedy Central digital show called Control Room, where Leeper plans to devise future commentary on why we're so gullible online. Alli and Jen talk to Leeper about the experiment, the new show, media literacy, fake news, and why reputable journalistic outlets were fooled into covering a company that doesn't exist.

      <itunes:subtitle>A social experiment for the age of misinformation.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Stand-up comedian Mekki Leeper wanted to see if he could convince the Internet to buy a fake wellness product. With some slick branding, fake Instagram followers, and the perfect media outrage hook, Leeper turned a Squarespace website and $1,000 into global demand for $80 used tissues. Vaev tissues claimed to get you sick today, so you'd be inoculated later. And people were willing to pay big bucks for these chic snot rags.
The viral success of this fake health product (akin to Goop and Raw Water) lead to a Comedy Central digital show called Control Room, where Leeper plans to devise future commentary on why we're so gullible online. Alli and Jen talk to Leeper about the experiment, the new show, media literacy, fake news, and why reputable journalistic outlets were fooled into covering a company that doesn't exist.

      <title>102 Reborns</title>
      <description>Reborns are baby dolls with hyper-realistic features. So real, in fact, that bringing them out in public will often fool strangers into thinking they're flesh and blood, even upon close examination. There's a passionate online community of artists and collectors who fawn over these dolls, which tread right through the Uncanny Valley. Why? Alli and Jen talk with Reborn artist and YouTuber Stephanie Ortiz about the appeal of realistic dolls, her meticulous crafting process, their therapeutic uses, and why the Internet is obsessed with her videos of the dolls in public, one of which has reached nearly 30 million views.

      <title>101 How to Make Real Money With Amazon's Mechanical Turk</title>
      <description>Amazon's Mechanical Turk service has a mixed reputation. Some see it as a way to turn found time into easy spending money. Others view it as crowd-sourced slave labor. 
 
While the majority of Mechanical Turk workers make very little money doing repetitive tasks like identifying images or taking surveys (and often give up on the platform entirely), there are some who have optimized the process to actually generate decent incomes. By studying the time-to-pay ratios of certain tasks and using basic tech tools to filter through millions of tiny jobs constantly posted to mTurk, so-called "Alpha Turkers" can turn small pockets of spare time into $200-$500 a week, which isn't bad if you also have a full-time income. 
 
Alli and Jen talk to Mike Naab, a longtime mTurker who makes decent money from the platform, and wrote the ebook Side Hustle From Home: How To Make Money Online With Amazon Mechanical Turk to help others do the same. Naab shares his tips, tricks, tools, and philosophies about mTurk, how he's leveraged it to his advantage, and why it's probably not for everyone.

      <title>99 International Dating Apps</title>
      <description>Anyone in a long distance relationship will tell you how hard it can be. And dating or marrying across countries comes with a huge list of expenses and immigration headaches. While people from different countries meet and fall in love all the time, why would anyone seek out a relationship with these complications from the start?
The "mail order bride" concept has been around for centuries, and the modern equivalent are dating apps that facilitate specific international relationships: ColumbianCupid, JamaicanDating, ChinaLoveCupid.  There's even a hit reality TV show called 90 Day Fiancé that has brought these apps into the zeitgeist. But as journalist Paul Schrodt discovered, while people sign up for these apps under a variety of circumstances, there is a prevailing theme: white American men of means connecting with attractive women from economically disadvantaged countries.
So, are these apps about fetishizing ethnicity and forming transnational relationships? Or is there something deeper to be gleaned from the successful marriages born of international dating apps? Alli and Jen talk to Schrodt about his experience using the apps and connecting with single men and women from around the globe.

      <title>98 ASK YOU ANYTHING with Gibi ASMR</title>
      <description>Welcome to a new episode format we like to call: ASK YOU ANYTHING, where we ask Internet-famous people awkward questions in a sad attempt to embarrass them for your entertainment! (Don't worry, we'll have a regular episode for you next week.)
This week we're joined by Gibi ASMR, a YouTuber and Internet content creator who specializes in ASMR — autonomous sensory meridian response.  Millions of people watch Gibi's videos and use the sounds of her voice and various materials to relax and feel those "tingles" on the back of their neck. Gibi was a 2G1P guest back on episode 10, and has since grown her channel to more than 2 million subscribers. She is among the most popular ASMRtists on the Internet.
So, can we make her blush by prying into her Google search history?

      <title>97 Crowdsourcing Mental Healthcare with 7 Cups</title>
      <description>More than 300,000 volunteers are standing by right now, 24/7, ready to listen if you need to talk to about depression, anxiety, self-harm, or just need to vent about a rough day. Texting with a listener who cares has meaningful therapeutic value, according to 7 Cups, a crowdsourced platform for mental health.
But how are these listeners trained, and how should these anonymous conversations about serious topics be moderated? The Internet is full of trolls, after all. And can anonymous texting ever replace face-to-face psychotherapy? Alli and Jen talk with Laura Small, director of community development, about the vision for 7 Cups as a global mental health community for those who may not have access to professionals.

      <title>96 Why is there so much Sonic the Hedgehog porn?</title>
      <description>There's plenty of sexy fan art for any movie, show, or game imaginable, thanks to Rule 34. But there's something about Sonic the Hedgehog that lends the character to very specific and often extreme fetish art, in limitless quantities. Why Sonic? Writer and weird Internet excavator  K. Thor Jensen walks Alli and Jen through the invention of the Internet's favorite blue speed demon, and the unique way he was positioned by his creators that set him up as a conduit for porn of all stripes.

      <title>95 Fake Facebook Events</title>
      <description>It's become clear that nearly all information you come across on Facebook (or any social media for that matter) should be consumed with skepticism. But there's something about the trouble of organizing a physical event and inviting real people to a real place, that seems beyond the realm of forgery. Turns out, it's the hottest new form of online/IRL trolling. And Facebook users fall for it hook, line, and sinker. When photographer and artist Eric Pickersgill discovered that folks were tricking users into showing up for fake Limp Bizkit concerts, he had to go to the IRL scene of the prank. There he found confused business owners and a bizarre confluence of meme culture and disappointed fans. Alli and Jen talk to Pickersgill about his photography project entitled No Show, and why we continue to be duped by online information when it comes to us in news feed form.

      <title>94 Sweepers</title>
      <description>Tom has been to the Super Bowl multiple times. He goes on free cruises yearly, has ridden on the Daytona 500 track at 200 miles per hour, traveled with the U.S. soccer team, and devoted a room of his house to store all the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and big screen TVs he's won over the years. That's because he enters more than 100 sweepstakes every single day, and thanks to a constant supply of free gift cards, he rarely pays for gas, cable, or his cell phone out of pocket. But he's not a wizard or a scammer. He's a Sweeper, and he's built a community of like-minded folks who share sweepstakes knowledge from around the country to beat the odds and get free stuff.
Alli and Jen get his tips on how to win, and learn about his journey from free fries at Burger King in the '80s to running a sweeper newsletter at iwincontests.com.

      <title>93 Macrophilia </title>
      <description>Macrophilia is a surprisingly popular fetish involving sexual fantasies about giants — specifically, giant women. Being at the mercy of giants, or being coddled or crushed by them are staples of the community, but size change motifs also are common. Stories and media about giants (like the 1958 horror B-movie Attack of the 50 Foot Woman) or size change (1989's Honey, I Shrunk the Kids) have become touch points for the macrophilia community, though many have also taken to making their own media and pornography using visual effects.
Alli and Jen talk with Pete, the webmaster of Giantess City, one of the largest online content and community hubs for macrophiles.

      <title>92 Unicorn Moms</title>
      <description>Perfect moms and unicorns have one thing in common: They don't exist. That mantra has brought together a huge community of women who are sick of the judgmental bickering that plagues typical "mommy groups" on social platforms like Facebook. Alli and Jen speak with Maria Hunt, the founder of Unicorn Moms, about her inspiration for starting a completely new kind of online support community for mothers. Spoiler alert: It involves a lot of drinking. Hunt explains the rules of her invite-only group (which is 34,000 strong), and how it's become a worldwide support system for women struggling to live up to the unrealistic standards of motherhood imposed online.

      <title>91 Murderinos</title>
      <description>The true crime explosion ignited by podcasts like Serial and Netflix series Making a Murderer has spawned a massive ecosystem of murdery content. One of the biggest and most passionate fandoms on the Internet today centers on two funny women and their obsession with real murder headlines, both new and historical. 
 
Their podcast, My Favorite Murder, has 19 million monthly downloads by conservative estimates. And the enormous community that gathers around it (whose members refer to themselves as "Murderinos") has a storied past full of in-fighting, fractured Facebook groups, merch gone wrong, and subreddit drama. 
 
Alli and Jen talk with u/TinaBelcher4Prez, the moderator of r/MyFavoriteMurder, the un-official (but largest) subreddit for fans of the show. She explains the broad appeal of the hosts, the grizzly subject matter, and its fascinating connection to mental health awareness. She also explains the fandom's many factions and controversies which have made listening to the show a roller coaster ride in recent years.

      <title>90 If you think dating is hard, try doing it at 60</title>
      <description>There's no shortage of dating horror stories on social media. But dating in your later years — after a divorce, death, or other major life change — can be especially daunting. And while apps and services can take the friction out of finding a match, they can also be incredibly overwhelming, and often don't cater to those 60 and older.
That's where Peggy Wolman steps in. She's a professional matchmaker with a focus on helping people find love later in life. She and her husband Richard work with clients to navigate the social media norms they may not be used to, and set the right expectations and goals for modern dating among the older set.
Alli and Jen talk with Peggy and Richard about the challenges and surprises older singles encounter when it's time to make a Tinder profile, why ghosting isn't always horrible, and navigating gender stereotypes on a first date.

      <title>89 Subverse: The porn video game that took Kickstarter by storm</title>
      <description>Adult content in video games is nothing new. Big budget franchises like Mass Effect and The Witcher series are noted for their character romances and sexy scenes. But in those games, sex is not the main attraction. It’s about gameplay and story. On the other side of the coin, Steam is awash in adult games featuring anime-inspired characters in various sexual situations. The gameplay is presumably nothing to write home about, but merely a vehicle for porn.
Enter: Subverse. This sci-fi/RPG/porn ’em up has raised more than $2 million on Kickstarter, ranking it among the 20 most-funded video games ever on the platform. Subverse is a rare breed that its developers tout as a true gameplay experience with very explicit sexual content. And 58,000 backers might indicate a very under-served market. Alli and Jen talk with Kristoff, the game’s senior producer, about the vision for Subverse and the studio’s journey from dabbling in Machinima porn to developing a full-fledged game. We also go back in time to learn about some of the sexually explicit video games made for the Atari 2600 in the early ’80s.

      <title>88 The 8-Bit Guy</title>
      <description>David Murray is known to millions of fans as "The 8-Bit Guy." His YouTube channel covers the gamut of computers, consumer electronics, and gaming consoles from the golden age of pixel art and command line operating systems: the '70s, '80s, and early '90s. His detailed tear-downs, restorations, and explanations of vintage technology have drawn a huge community of enthusiasts — and not just the stereotypical "middle aged geek." People of all ages and backgrounds flock to Murray's convention booths (and even his home!) to snag an autograph from the retro guru. Alli and Jen chat with Murray about his roots in computer repair, the evolution of tech, the excitement of restoring a Commodore 64, the design challenges of old-school programming, and the community that's formed around his channel.

      <title>87 Birds of North America</title>
      <description>Bird watching probably conjures images of an old, retired guy sporting binoculars behind his country home. But Jason Ward is rapidly dispelling that stereotype. He's been an avid birder since his childhood growing up in The Bronx, NY, and has brought his passion to social media. His #TrickyBirdID Twitter threads challenge people to snap photos of unknown neighborhood birds so the global community of birders can identify them. His enthusiasm led him to make the popular webseries Birds of North America with Topic, where viewers can follow Ward on his adventures in urban birding. The beautiful and informative show proves that cities are in fact a great place for bird watchers, and that the hobby is an accessible way for everyone to reconnect with nature, regardless of class, color, or location. Alli and Jen talk to Ward about his love of birds, his journey from enthusiast to science communicator, his trepidation about making a show, and the modern tech that makes bird watching in 2019 so much fun.
Birds of North America has returned for a second season (June 9), and Ward will also be speaking and sharing bird songs at Topic Talks at the Skirball Center in New York City on June 22.

      <itunes:subtitle>Where Twitter and bird watching make beautiful music.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Bird watching probably conjures images of an old, retired guy sporting binoculars behind his country home. But Jason Ward is rapidly dispelling that stereotype. He's been an avid birder since his childhood growing up in The Bronx, NY, and has brought his passion to social media. His #TrickyBirdID Twitter threads challenge people to snap photos of unknown neighborhood birds so the global community of birders can identify them. His enthusiasm led him to make the popular webseries Birds of North America with Topic, where viewers can follow Ward on his adventures in urban birding. The beautiful and informative show proves that cities are in fact a great place for bird watchers, and that the hobby is an accessible way for everyone to reconnect with nature, regardless of class, color, or location. Alli and Jen talk to Ward about his love of birds, his journey from enthusiast to science communicator, his trepidation about making a show, and the modern tech that makes bird watching in 2019 so much fun.
Birds of North America has returned for a second season (June 9), and Ward will also be speaking and sharing bird songs at Topic Talks at the Skirball Center in New York City on June 22.

      <title>86 Death Cafe</title>
      <description>Death is a difficult topic no matter how you slice it, but cultivating a healthier outlook on end-of-life issues can have profound effects on families when they encounter loss. That's the mission of Death Cafe. It's a self-described "social franchise" — a set of ideals that can be replicated in small groups around the world. It's not a support group, but a way to get people talking about death in a productive manner. After all, it's a social and personal issue that everyone will face at some point in their lives. The IRL groups have spread far and wide thanks to the power of the Internet. Alli and Jen speak with Megan Mooney, an end-of-life and hospice care specialist who has hosted Death Cafes for more than 6 years. Mooney discusses the personal journey that led her to this work, and the power of online and offline communities when it comes to coping with mortality.

      <description>In an age where nearly all information is a Google or Wiki search away, it's easy to forget that real, first-hand experiences of what the world used to be like are right in our own families and communities. That's the mission of the subreddit r/AskOldPeople. It's a place for members of one generation to get perspective from those who came before. The result has been some deep conversations about politics, personal finance, technology, and the timeless personal wisdom you just can't get from the news or a textbook. Alli and Jen speak to GetOffMyLawn, a moderator who curated some of the best conversations the subreddit has to offer.

      <title>84 Best of Nextdoor</title>
      <description>Nextdoor is the social network that connects people based on neighborhoods, rather than friend networks or common interests. Getting to know your IRL neighbors sure seems like a good idea. But at times, it combines the two worst things about social media: relative anonymity and real-world consequences. The platform is home to countless petty squabbles and strange behavior that reveal the absurdity of modern life, and the insanity of the people who live two houses down. The most ridiculous posts are lovingly collected by @BestOfNextdoor, a Twitter and Facebook account run by Jenn Takahashi. It features hilarious neighborhood drama, bizarre phenomena ("Did any of you leave a potato in my garden?"), and misguided souls who insist on using Nextdoor to score hookups. Alli and Jen talk with Takahashi about her favorite Nextdoor posts of all time, why people are so weird, and what the company thinks of her social commentary.

      <title>83 Searching for the Hidden Treasure of Forrest Fenn</title>
      <description>There's a box of treasure worth millions somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, and a global online (and IRL) community is devoted to the search. The treasure was hidden by Forrest Fenn, a collector of antiquities and nature lover, who — after cancer threatened his life in the '80s — decided to have some fun with the wealth he'd accumulated. He wrote a poem full of cryptic, geographic clues that are now a worldwide obsession. And while Fenn says seekers have gotten close, no one has uncovered the real fortune ... yet. Entire families have uprooted their lives to join the hunt, and a fervent online community deciphers clues and poses new theories daily. Alli and Jen talk with Dal Neitzel, who documents the treasure hunt extensively online, and has become a key resource for all things Fenn. Neitzel shares his stories about meeting Fenn, the most plausible cartographic theories, the risks of treasure hunting (some seekers have died), and the scammers who try to trick Fenn out of his hidden fortunes.

      <title>82 God</title>
      <description>For thousands of years, God has communicated with humanity via dusty tomes, prophets, and the occasional miracle. But it's 2019, and the Internet is way more efficient for reaching the flock. That's why God has spent the last few years amassing followers on Facebook and Twitter, and smiting hypocrites and blasphemers (aka trolls) with his digital wrath. And if you've noticed that He's a little less about fire and brimstone, and more about calling bullshit on modern religion, you're not wrong. Alli and Jen have an intimate and exclusive conversation with The Almighty about His new social media strategy, His role in American politics, Jesus, the conservatives who keep putting words in His mouth, dick pics, and his new podcast, The God Show.

        <![CDATA[<p>For thousands of years, God has communicated with humanity via dusty tomes, prophets, and the occasional miracle. But it's 2019, and the Internet is way more efficient for reaching the flock. That's why God has spent the last few years amassing followers on Facebook and Twitter, and smiting hypocrites and blasphemers (aka trolls) with his digital wrath. And if you've noticed that He's a little less about fire and brimstone, and more about calling bullshit on modern religion, you're not wrong. Alli and Jen have an intimate and exclusive conversation with The Almighty about His new social media strategy, His role in American politics, Jesus, the conservatives who keep putting words in His mouth, dick pics, and his new podcast, <a href="https://apple.co/2GLx6PK">The God Show</a>.</p><p>Follow The Lord Thy God: </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thegoodgodabove">https://twitter.com/thegoodgodabove</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGoodLordAbove/">https://www.facebook.com/TheGoodLordAbove</a></p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thegodshow">https://www.patreon.com/thegodshow</a></p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a></p><p>Join us on Discord: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Talk to Alli and Jen:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alligold">https://twitter.com/alligold</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/joonbugger">https://twitter.com/joonbugger</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>81 How Linguist David J. Peterson Created the Dothraki and Valyrian Languages for 'Game of Thrones'</title>
      <description>When fantasy TV shows need an alien or elf to speak a fictional language, most writers make up a few foreign-sounding words to pad the script and move on. But that won't cut it when it comes to Game of Thrones, a show with details as deep as its fandom. So when George R. R. Martin and the show's producers needed to build complete, functional languages for Dothraki riders and Valyrian-speaking slavers, they turned to real-life linguist and "conlanger" David J. Peterson. He transformed a handful of phrases from Martin's books into the grammatically complete languages we hear on HBO today. 
Alli and Jen chat with Peterson (mostly in English!) about his love of languages, the process of building them from scratch, infusing fictional languages with fictional culture, his email correspondence with George R. R. Martin, and how the complexities of producing TV's most ambitious show affected his phonetic and linguistic choices — including a little-known error in season 8!
Alli and Jen also speak with a Game of Thrones super fan who is currently learning High Valyrian from the language app Duolingo, which has more than 800,000 users actively learning the fictional language.
Minor spoiler warning: While mostly focused on linguistics, this episode contains general discussions of characters, cultures, and events in Game of Thrones.
Special thanks to Michelle Jaworski.

      <title>80 Feminist Memes Are a Banner of Social Change on Instagram</title>
      <description>We don't always think of Internet memes as a force for serious social change. But the humor behind image macros and mashup content can be leveraged in the fight against toxic masculinity — with the right talent, of course. Julia Hava has amassed a huge following on Instagram (@binchcity) by turning sexist advertising into hilarious commentary on feminism and mental illness. Alli and Jen talk to Hava about the modern feminist conversation happening online, and how memes and humor play an increasingly important role.
Follow Binch City: https://www.instagram.com/binchcity
Here's the video from the Clayman Institute for Gender Research about unconscious bias, which Alli references in the episode: https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/level
This episode was co-produced and edited by Sophie Bridges.

      <title>79 How Could Anyone Really Believe the Earth is Flat?</title>
      <description>A growing number of people believe that world governments and other shadow organizations are hiding the truth: that the Earth is not a globe, but a flat disc with a dome of stars above it. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, this "mother of all conspiracy theories" is flourishing on the Internet, giving rise to vast networks of YouTubers, podcasters, and social media communities that spread misinformation. This phenomenon led three filmmakers to ask: Why is this happening now, and how could any rational person actually believe the Earth is flat? They found the answer by making Behind the Curve, a sympathetic and open-minded documentary which chronicles a number of influential flat Earthers as they defend their theories, conduct experiments, and gear up for the first Flat Earth convention. Alli and Jen speak with Caroline Clark (producer), Daniel J. Clark (director/producer), and Nick Andert (editor/producer), about the psychology of conspiratorial thinking, the algorithms that serve us bad information, and the social pressures that hook marginalized people with the promise of finding a like-minded community that they can never leave.

      <title>78 Can Instagram save independent book stores?</title>
      <description>While it may feel like books face an existential crisis in the shadow of digital media, reading communities are alive and well in an unlikely social media sphere: Instagram. Showing off what you're reading with a fancy cup of coffee is only a small part of the #bookstagram trend. Insta has become a powerful tool for author discovery (especially for female writers of color), community, accountability, and marketing the wares of independent book stores. Alli and Jen talk with Tammy Gordon, who challenged herself to read 100 books in one year, and Katie Orphan, manager of The Last Bookstore, the most Instagrammed bookstore in Los Angeles, about the future of reading in a social media world.

      <title>77 April Fools: 3 Chrome Extensions to Prank Your Friends</title>
      <description>On the list of "Things The Internet Is Useful For," lulz rank pretty highly (second only to porn, of course).
Online pranks are as old as the ARPANET itself. This April Fools' Day, 2G1P is celebrating internet jokesters by chatting with three developers who can turn your web browser (or a co-worker's, if you're sneaky enough) into a veritable fun house of chortles, guffaws, and confusion.
 Alli and Jen talk with Eric Bailey, Clayburn Griffin, and Steven Frank, about their devious Chrome extensions which will transform Millennials to "Snake People," "The Cloud" into "My Butt," and plaster Nicolas Cage all over Wikipedia.

      <title>76 Musketeers: The Global Elon Musk Super Fan Network</title>
      <description>Worldwide and obsessive fandom is nothing new, but it's usually reserved for pop stars, actors, YouTubers, and video games. It's rare for tech CEOs to command such loyalty, but Elon Musk's journey from sickly, bullied child, to stumbling entrepreneur, to rocket-launching world changer is a story that's impossible to ignore. Musk has engendered a global community of superfans who hang on his every word, and who will defend him at any cost. Alli and Jen chat with Paula Mellon, the creator of a massive Musk fan club on LinkedIn, about the appeal of Musk and why his fans are so obsessed.

      <title>75 The Power of Parasocial Relationships in the Age of Loneliness</title>
      <description>When TV and radio brought the voices and images of public figures into our very homes, we began to feel kinship with people we've never actually met. But these one-sided "parasocial" relationships have kicked into overdrive with the advent of social media. Now we subscribe to the daily minutia of YouTubers and Instagram influencers under the guise that this format is more honest — more "real" — than the scripted world of mass media. The bonds we feel across the Internet can be powerful and life-changing, but occasionally, unhealthy. Alli and Jen talk with Dr. Leslie Rasmussen, a professor of communications at Xavier University, who studies the intense psyschological phenomenon of parasocial relationships at a time where we are more connected and disconnected than ever.

      <title>74 Transhumanism and the Next Phase of Human Evolution</title>
      <description>As we become ever more physically entwined with our technology, and medicine extends our lives beyond anything our ancestors could imagine, we may not be too far away from implanting or genetically manipulating superhuman powers, or even escaping death entirely. If that sounds pretty cool and pretty terrifying at the same time, you're not alone. Alli and Jen talk transhumanist future shock with Dr. Natasha Vita-More, the executive director of Humanity+, an organization devoted to enhancing the quality of human life through technology.

      <title>73 Hire This Tinder Ghostwriter If You Suck at Online Dating</title>
      <description>Some people are great at taking flattering selfies and writing witty Tinder taglines. Others, not so much. That's where Meredith Golden comes in. For a fee, she'll take over your profile, learn your voice, and optimize your flirting so you don't screw it up. Then she'll hand the reigns back to you for the IRL date. The system works, and Golden has the record to prove it. But what are the ethics of outsourcing your love life to a consultant? Jen and Alli go deep with Golden and get the skinny on the foolish ways people shoot themselves in the foot on dating apps (headless selfies, anyone?).

      <title>72 The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</title>
      <description>In 2005, Bobby Henderson wrote a letter to the Kansas board of education suggesting that if Christian creationism is taught in schools, so should his theistic view: that a Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. And so, Pastafarianism was born. The Internet-based social movement spread rapidly as a critique of anti-science fundamentalism, but in some corners of the world like New Zealand, Pastafarianism became recognized by the government as a religious order, with all the rights and privileges afforded. Alli and Jen talk with Prime Minesteroni Karen Martyn, an ordained minister of the Church, who has officiated numerous pasta-themed weddings within the legal borders of New Zealand.

      <title>71 Subtle Asian Dating</title>
      <description>If data-driven matchmaking platforms like Tinder have you down, consider an "old school" online dating method where your friends auction you off in a Facebook group with 300,000 singles who are ready to meme...I mean, mingle. That's how it goes down in "Subtle Asian Dating," a thriving Facebook community where Asian Americans can comfortably dish about their cultural identity and perhaps even meet "the one" with enough likes and comments. It grew out of a predecessor Facebook group called "Subtle Asian Traits," where members of the Asian American community would not so subtly thrust their friends onto the dating meat market in a defiantly anti-Tinder way. Alli and Jen talk with Hella Chen who created this romance ecosystem. Chen shares the meme-worthy stories that have sprung from it.

        <![CDATA[<p>If data-driven matchmaking platforms like Tinder have you down, consider an "old school" online dating method where your friends auction you off in a Facebook group with 300,000 singles who are ready to meme...I mean, mingle. That's how it goes down in "Subtle Asian Dating," a thriving Facebook community where Asian Americans can comfortably dish about their cultural identity and perhaps even meet "the one" with enough likes and comments. It grew out of a predecessor Facebook group called "Subtle Asian Traits," where members of the Asian American community would not so subtly thrust their friends onto the dating meat market in a defiantly anti-Tinder way. Alli and Jen talk with Hella Chen who created this romance ecosystem. Chen shares the meme-worthy stories that have sprung from it.</p><p>Support 2G1P on Patreon! <a href="https://www.patreon.com/2G1P">https://www.patreon.com/2G1P</a></p><p>Join us on Discord: <a href="http://discord.gg/2g1p">discord.gg/2g1p</a></p><p>Email us: <a href="mailto:2G1Podcast@gmail.com">2G1Podcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>Talk to Alli and Jen:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/alligold">https://twitter.com/alligold</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/joonbugger">https://twitter.com/joonbugger</a></p><p>Call the show and leave a message!

      <title>70 This Couple Fell In Love on MySpace and Now Make Their Living Being Adorable on the Internet</title>
      <description>Before Tinder, Grindr, J-Date and Christian Mingle, most of us just had a MySpace page and the dream of finding true love in a sea of extremely emo profile pics. Megan (from the U.S.) and Whitney (from the UK) started a long-distance relationship there, which blossomed against all odds into a international marriage, a TV appearance on Say Yes to the Dress, and a media empire focused on empowering LGBT couples. Their story is a beacon of hope that yes, long distance relationships can have a happy ending, thanks to the power of the Internet. Alli and Jen chat with Megan and Whitney (collectively known as "WEGAN") about their journey, their vision for the future of Internet-first love, and their disgustingly cute plans for Valentine's Day.

      <title>69 How Facebook Helped a Woman With a Rare Disease Find the Freedom to Be Herself</title>
      <description>Most of the tales that come out of Facebook these days are about the attention sucking qualities that make it terrible for mental health and democracy. But there are shining beacons of hope where the platform has empowered communities that could not exist IRL or elsewhere on the Internet. Ashley Eakin is a filmmaker with an extremely rare bone disease that caused her great insecurity when posting online. That all changed when a powerful video about her story went viral across Facebook. The Facebook groups that since formed around coping with these "physical differences" have profoundly changed her life, and the lives of others in this new online community. Alli and Jen talk with Eakin about her inspiring story of personal struggle and empowerment.

      <title>68 Everything you'll ever say, think, and write is already in this online library</title>
      <description>If you do enough math, you can generate every combination of letters and numbers possible. Most of the results will be gibberish, but they will also contain Shakespeare, Harry Potter, the unpublished final Game of Thrones book, your 6th grade diary, the actual cure for cancer, and every email and text message anyone has ever sent — or will ever send — ever. Even the words I'm typing right now already exist somewhere in the Library of Babel, an algorithm conceived by evil genius/literature student Jonathan Basile. This is the digital equivalent of "infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters" eventually writing Hamlet. But when you see it in action, live on the Internet, you will question your own free will and doubt the very concept of original thought. Alli and Jen speak to Basile about the inspiration for this terrifying project and the deep existential panic it causes.

      <title>67 This "scientist" learned what women find attractive by A/B testing his beard on Tinder</title>
      <description>Apps like Tinder know a lot about you, but why should they horde all your dating data? In order to settle an argument, one man conducted an exhaustive experiment on the platform to determine if he was more attractive with a beard or without. He shared the results on the subreddit r/dataisbeautiful. He woke up the next morning to thousands of comments about this methodology, graphs, and why his chin was ugly. The discussion about attractiveness, cultural biases, data, and controlling variables in an online dating environment went viral. But did he actually get a date?
Alli and Jen speak to "The Scientist" about his process, expectations, and why beards are so polarizing.

      <title>66 What the '90s Web Can Teach Us About the Future of the Internet</title>
      <description>The History of the Web is a weekly newsletter that began as a place for coders to reminisce about CSS and Bulletin Board software.  But it quickly evolved into a definitive timeline of our shared online history. The story of the Web (the public-facing network of pages that everyone has access to) is arguably the most important sociological endeavor of our time. Alli and Jen chat with Jay Hoffmann, author of The History of the Web, about the proto-communities that formed online in the '90s around weblogs, browser wars, grief, and virtual pets.

      <title>65 How the transgender community found a safe haven on Discord</title>
      <description>Has the internet made things easier for the transgender community? That may depend on which corners of the web you hang out in. For Luna Baker (who transitioned from male-at-birth to female), a variety of digital havens for trans people came and went: Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Facebook groups, etc. Harassment and bullying followed in all of them. She finally arrived at Discord, where strict permissions and moderation carved out a place where members of the trans community could talk about anything, free from the pressures of typical online discussion. This week on 2 Girls 1 Podcast, Alli and Jen talk with Baker about her transition, the digital trans community, portrayals of trans people in media, and the complicated laws and norms that can hinder trans people from seeking the treatment they need.
This week's episode is supported by Penguin Random House Audio, which publishes thousands of award-winning audiobooks every year, including your sci-fi and fantasy favorites like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and Hank Green's novels. Download Penguin Random House Audio books wherever you listen to your favorite audiobooks (Audible, Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, etc.) or check out http://www.penguinrandomhouseaudio.com/2Girls1Podcast to browse their latest selection.

      <itunes:subtitle>“We view gender as a sledgehammer, but it’s actually a butterfly.”  </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Has the internet made things easier for the transgender community? That may depend on which corners of the web you hang out in. For Luna Baker (who transitioned from male-at-birth to female), a variety of digital havens for trans people came and went: Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Facebook groups, etc. Harassment and bullying followed in all of them. She finally arrived at Discord, where strict permissions and moderation carved out a place where members of the trans community could talk about anything, free from the pressures of typical online discussion. This week on 2 Girls 1 Podcast, Alli and Jen talk with Baker about her transition, the digital trans community, portrayals of trans people in media, and the complicated laws and norms that can hinder trans people from seeking the treatment they need.

      <title>64 This Couple Quit the Internet for 1 Month and Lived to Vlog About It</title>
      <description>Craig Benzine (better known as WheezyWaiter on YouTube) has been making online videos for a living since 2007.  That's a long time to be living and working on the Internet, and when he felt social media was sucking up all his time, he challenged himself to quit for an entire month. His wife Chyna, feeling similar stress, joined the cause. The couple went dark(ish) for 30 days, then resurfaced with a hilarious video about what they learned from being disconnected for so long in a 2018 world. Alli and Jen talk to Craig and Chyna about their life-altering experiment, and what it might mean for your digital habits.

      <title>63 Getting Plastic Surgery to Match Your Filtered, Perfect Selfies</title>
      <description>As media has shifted from broadcast to social, so too have our perceptions of beauty and self-confidence. Plastic surgeons are seeing their patients get younger, and who aspire to look more like their own highly curated selfies, rather than a celebrity or model. What does this say about a culture that is increasingly focused on documenting self image? Alli and Jen speak to Marla Frezza, who modified her nose to match her own selfie filters. They're also joined by producer Maria Chiu, who documented Marla's journey in a video for Broadly/VICE, entitled "I Got Surgery to Look Like My Snapchat and Facetune Selfies."

      <title>62 The 'Universal Language' of Esperanto Is Thriving on the Internet</title>
      <description>Esperanto is a language invented 130 years ago with the goal of uniting the world under a simplified common tongue and creating everlasting peace. Spoiler alert: That never happened. But the Internet is rekindling the passion of the global Esperanto community, and millions of people are speaking and learning it through the power of language courses like Duolingo and online communities. Alli and Jen talk with Stela Besenyei-Merger, one of only 350 native Esperanto speakers in the world, and Chuck Smith, who is credited for bringing Esperanto onto the mainstream web and developing a Wikipedia in the language. What does it mean to speak Esperanto in 2018, and how is the "DNA" of this language bridging communication gaps in the 21st century?

      <title>61 How 3D Printing Is Transforming the Board Game Industry</title>
      <description>What if you could 3D print that new lamp, designed by an Internet stranger for free, rather than ordering it from Amazon? When 3D printing tech goes mainstream, it will almost certainly revolutionize ecommerce (and create a whole new kind of online piracy). But until then, we're observing a microcosm of that play out in the tabletop gaming space, where designers are modeling pieces and creating entirely new games that players can download, print, or play virtually. Alli and Jen talk to Arian Croft (aka dutchmogul) of Ill Gotten Games, one of the most prolific and well-followed designers on Thingiverse, about this passionate community.

      <title>60 How One Guy Tricked the Internet Into Thinking His Shed Was London's Best Restaurant</title>
      <description>When Oobah Butler was hard-up for cash, he found a gig writing fake reviews for London restaurants he'd never been to. He fell into an abyss of forgeries on TripAdvisor that gave him an idea. What if he invented a fake restaurant, powered by more fake reviews, to fool everyone? The performance art stunt took on a life of its own, and compelled him to have a fake grand opening of "The Shed," London's #1 restaurant on the Internet -- which served microwave meals in Butler's backyard. The ultimate "Emperor Has No Clothes" story propelled Butler to worldwide fame, where he continued to trick the media by hiring actors to portray him in interviews.
Alli and Jen have a long talk with Butler about why the anonymity of the Internet makes people so gullible.

      <title>59 Creepypasta and the Evolution of Internet Horror Storytelling</title>
      <description>Ghost stories around the campfire are as old as humanity itself, but spooky tales became memes unto themselves as the Web matured. Creepypasta (a derivative of "copypasta" which is derivative of "copy/paste") is the catch-all term and dominant wiki for the spooky stories that circulate and mutate on the Internet. Alli and Jen talk to Andrew Movitz (aka ClericOfMadness), the founder of the Creepypasta wiki, about why these stories tap our deepest fears, and the transformation of Creepypasta culture into an author-centric community.

      <title>58 Meet the unlikely duo fighting Facebook's rampant romance scams</title>
      <description>When Bryan Denny, a retired 26-year U.S. army veteran, started getting marriage proposals from strangers on Facebook, he knew something was up. Thousands of scammers were using stolen pictures of him in uniform to trick well-meaning Facebook users into sending money, iPhones, and gift cards overseas to a military hero with an honest face. Kathy Waters' family friend was among the victims. Denny and Waters now spend their free time busting fake accounts and pleading with lawmakers and Facebook for a solution. Alli and Jen talk to the dynamic duo about their crusade to stem the Facebook romance scam epidemic.

      <title>56 Inside the terrifying rabbit hole of messed-up YouTube videos for kids</title>
      <description>If you leave a toddler alone with an iPad long enough, YouTube's algorithms will guide her down a deep, dark rabbit hole of strange, low-quality, and often disturbing videos manufactured for kid consumption. These channels use recognizable characters (Mickey Mouse, Paw Patrol) to draw kids into horrifying click-bait narratives they can't resist. Who is making these videos, and what is YouTube doing about it? Alli and Jen talk to K.G. Orphanides who has written extensively about YouTube's strange kid content underbelly.

      <title>55 Composer Kevin MacLeod Somehow Makes a Living by Giving All His Music Away for Free</title>
      <description>If you've ever sought a soundtrack for your home movies that wouldn't get removed by YouTube, chances are you've come across Kevin MacLeod's music. He's composed thousands of original tracks, in every imaginable genre, that he gives away under a Creative Commons license, on a variety of platforms, absolutely free. His music has been used in commercials, films, video games, and an uncountable number of YouTube videos and podcasts without any compensation. So, how does Kevin feed himself? Alli and Jen untangle the livelihood of the internet's most prolific composer and Creative Commons pioneer.

      <title>54 How Tay Zonday survived being 'Patient Zero' of viral YouTube</title>
      <description>Way back in 2007 Tay Zonday uploaded the original song "Chocolate Rain" to YouTube, and nothing happened. Then Digg and 4chan found it. And then Zonday was on CNN and Jimmy Kimmel trying to explain his music on national television. His meteoric rise led to a 10-year journey of identity confusion, and eventually self-actualization. Alli and Jen have a long, deep talk with Tay about coping with viral fame and his new podcast about that very topic, called "Chocolate Pains."

      <title>53 Botnik's Algorithms Create TV Shows and Harry Potter Books Too Hilarious to Ignore</title>
      <description>Robots have a long way to go before they replace artists and writers...but they're getting closer. A collective known as Botnik is using algorithms, predictive text, and machine learning to challenge our traditional notions of art, and create some hilarious TV Guide show synopses in the process. Alli and Jen speak with Jamie Brew, the creator of Botnik, about his ambitions to build new creativity tools for the digital age.

      <title>52 Bad Dragon: The Marriage of High Fantasy Art and Sex Toys</title>
      <description>Rule 34 is alive and well on the Internet, but the enterprising sex toy company Bad Dragon has taken it even further with their epic dildo designs that imagine what kind of heat our favorite high fantasy creatures might be packing: dragons, aliens, elves, and even a demogorgon. Turns out there's a huge market for fulfilling sexual fantasies, Tolkien-style. Alli and Jen speak with Derek "Tsukaza" Young, a representative of the toy company, about the evolution of these products, what customers keep asking for, and the online communities that have formed around them.

      <title>51 The Birth of Online Dating</title>
      <description>Kids today have it easy, with their "swiping right" and their "J-dates." Back in the early '90s, you could barely send a profile pic to your crush. Gary Kremen wanted to change that. He co-founded Match.com, disrupted the personal ads industry, and forever changed how humans fall in love. Alli and Jen ask Kremen about the tumultuous early startup days, the data behind lasting relationships, and why they're still single after countless Tinder matches.
